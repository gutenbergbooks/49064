JOHN ROLLER COLLINS<br />
A THINKER OF THOUGHTS<br />
NEW AND NOVEL</p>

<hr />


<h2 id="PREFACE"><span class="bold">A WORD TO THE BOY</span></h2>


<p>Every boy is a born inventor.</p>

<p>And since you are a boy it follows as the night the
day that you have your share of inventive ability and
you ought to make good use of it.</p>

<p>To find out some new way of making or doing a
thing&mdash;for this is what inventing means&mdash;is the
most fascinating game that I know of to take up a
fellow’s time and thought and energy.</p>

<p>You may say how about wireless, or star-gazing,
or baseball, or shooting, or chess, or any one of a
dozen other pastimes and sports and I shall be bound
to admit that all of them are highly entertaining and
some of them instructive but inventing is all that the
others are and besides it is <i>constructive</i> while they
are not.</p>

<p>By constructive I mean that you take an idea that
had its origin in your brain and this vague, intangible
conception, which takes up no space, has no
weight and is not bound by time, you build up step
by step of wood and steel and like materials until at
last you have created something out of nothing, or as
nearly as it can be done.</p>

<p>To watch your invention grow, especially if you
build it with your own hands, from the time you make
the first rough sketch of your idea until it stands completed
and in working order, gives you a wonderful
feeling of pride and satisfaction for you are the
<i>creator</i> of it and this means that you are more than
a mere boy, greater than an ordinary man&mdash;that you
are in very truth a <i>demi-god</i>.</p>

<p>These are the real pleasures of inventing but to
make a success of it you have to drop back to earth
again and take up the mean, the sordid part, and that
is to try to make money out of it. And if you have
an invention of merit you will have to forget that
you are a demi-god and become a hard and fast mortal
again or it will not be long before some other body
owns it lock, barrel and stock; and then you will have
a chance to start another idea rolling and to build up
another invention.</p>

<p>In this book I have tried to point out to you not
only how to invent, but how to make money out of
your invention as well, and so, I say unto you, from
the moment the big idea strikes you be as gentle as
a dove and as wise as a serpent, to the end that your
days as an inventor may be long and that any profits
which may accrue from your invention will be yours
instead of some one’s else. And now may peace be
with you.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAP_I">CHAPTER I<br />
GETTING AN IDEA</h2>


<p>Almost every one has had, at some time or other an
<i>idea</i> for a new <i>invention</i> or of how some old <i>device</i>
could be improved.</p>

<p>To get an original idea for an invention is in itself a
mark of genius, but it is not enough to make it a success
and if you do not know how to develop it you are
almost certain to give up before you have completed
it.</p>

<p>And to give up a good idea and then find that some
one else has thought of the same thing later, worked it
up and made money out of it gives a fellow a most uncomfortable
feeling about what might have been.</p>

<p>Now my purpose is not to tell you <i>what</i> to invent as
much as it is to tell you <i>how</i> to invent and, if when
you get an idea that you believe worth while you will
follow it up step by step as I have outlined in this book
you will at least save yourself time, worry and money
and you stand a chance of winning fame, glory, and a
bank account.</p>

<p class="mt2" id="HOW_TO"><b>How to Get an Idea.&mdash;</b>There is only one way to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
invent a new thing or to make an improvement on
something that has already been invented and that is to
get an idea.</p>



<div id="FIG_1" class="figcenter">

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 1.</span> <span class="smcap1">A POPULAR IDEA OF AN INVENTIVE GENIUS</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>And what, you may wonder, is an idea? It is easy
to say that it is a <i>notion</i> that comes into your head, or
a thought that springs into your mind. But I doubt if
even a <i>psychologist</i> could explain just what an idea is
or how one originates in the mind any more than a
<i>biologist</i> could tell how the germ of life is retained in
a seed and how it grows when it is planted.</p>

<p>One good thing about an idea, though, is that we
don’t have to know what the mysterious thing is or
how it springs into being in the mind. In this way an
idea is very much like electricity&mdash;we don’t know exactly
what it is but we do know a good deal about how
it works and this is enough for our present purpose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p class="mt2" id="RAW"><b>The First Raw Idea.&mdash;</b>There are several ways by
which you may get an idea for an invention but in any
case the first raw idea, or <i>inductive discovery</i>, as it is
called in <i>philosophy</i>, must and does come from something
outside the mind, something that you have seen,
heard, smelled, tasted or felt, and when your mind is
in the right condition to receive an idea of this kind
you will know it when it comes and grasp it very
quickly, that is if you are a real inventor.</p>


<div id="FIG_2" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_b_003.png" width="300" height="375" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 2.</span> <span class="smcap1">WHERE THE BIG IDEA REALLY ORIGINATES</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>There are many kinds of raw, or original ideas and
they show themselves in various ways. You may get
a very vague idea of an invention, or of an improvement,
or it may be a clean cut one on the jump; it may
be a very valuable idea or it may be a wholly worthless
one, but it is generally easy after you get one to
enlarge upon it, as we shall presently see, and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
build up in the mind’s eye a structure so that you can
guess pretty nearly whether you will have a palace, an
architectural monstrosity or a chicken-coop when it is
done.</p>

<p>A first, or raw idea may come to a fellow, who is on
inventing bent, in any one of several ways but chiefly
when (1) he is conjuring up in his mind something
which he has seen or heard; (2) when something happens
by accident which shows him an effect or a result
that is new, and (3) when he is looking at or
working on some device or machine; and this last way
is the one that is most productive of ideas for useful
improvements.</p>

<p>As an example of getting an idea behold a young
man rocking in a chair with closed eyes; he is thinking
of nothing in particular but of a good many things
quite vaguely. A thought of his sister packing her
trunk&mdash;in the way a woman usually packs a trunk&mdash;comes
into his mind and then an idea strikes him that
it would be a good scheme for a trunk to have drawers
in it like a bureau. The result of this raw idea is the
<i>wardrobe trunk</i> as we know it to-day.</p>

<p class="mt2" id="ACCID"><b>Accidental Discoveries.&mdash;</b>Once in a long while
some one hits upon an invention purely by accident.</p>

<p>A good illustration which covers the point was the
discovery of <i>vulcanized rubber</i>. The story goes that
Charles Goodyear happened to drop some crude rubber
and sulphur on a hot stove at the same time with the
result that it was made much stronger and more elastic
than before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>Experiment showed that the vulcanized rubber could
be made as soft or as hard as desired by using more or
less sulphur and applying more or less heat. From
this discovery of Goodyear’s has sprung the gigantic
rubber industry of to-day.</p>

<p>Discoveries of this kind were often made in the early
days of invention but the principles which underlie all
of the sciences are now so well known that invention
itself has been brought down to a scientific basis; and
instead of inventors being long-haired, dreaming
Micawbers they are generally men of education and
genius too, trained along the lines they are working
in and who look like clean-cut business men; and if
they are successful inventors you may depend upon
it they are business men.</p>

<p>When I say that they are men of learning I do not
mean that it takes a college professor to be a big inventor;
indeed very few college professors have the
genius to be inventors and too many inventors have too
little knowledge along the line in which they are working.
Of the two genius is the greatest for it is bred in
the bone while any one can educate himself.</p>

<p>To make the point clear here are three famous men
of genius and who were largely self-taught.</p>

<p>Faraday who made the dynamo and motor possible
was a poor, uneducated boy with a burning thirst for
knowledge when he was apprenticed to Davy at the
Royal Institution in London. Edison had about as little
schooling as the law allows, but he taught himself
science and he now stands head and shoulders above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
all the rest of the great inventors. And Marconi, a
young fellow of 23, invented the wireless telegraph
while the greatest scientists of the world could not do
it until he showed them how.</p>

<p class="mt2" id="OUT_IDEAS"><b>Thought Out Ideas.&mdash;</b>There are very few inventions
which are complete when the first idea of it comes
into the mind, but instead nearly all of them require
thinking out, or <i>deductive proof</i> as it is called in philosophy.</p>

<p>This second process of thinking consists of turning
the raw idea over and over in your mind so that you
can judge whether it is good or not, how it will work
out and other things about it, and to do this you must
know as many of the facts relating to it as you can
and when you have these all clear and catalogued in
your mind your idea then takes on the aspect of an invention.</p>

<p>The two usual ways to get the needed facts are (1)
to read up on the subject, and (2) to experiment along
the line of your idea. Of course if it is your regular
work that has called forth your first idea it is quite
likely you will have all of the facts you need to go
ahead and work the thing out; but if your idea is about
a device, or a machine, or a compound you know nothing
of your best plan is to read up on the subject and
follow up your reading by making a number of experiments.</p>

<p class="mt2" id="READING"><b>Reading up Your Subject.&mdash;</b>In this day of public
libraries it is easy to get books on any subject unless it
is one on sunsets and sunsets don’t count in inventing&mdash;in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
fact nothing counts except the big idea, a shop
or a laboratory to develop it in and burning the midnight
incandescent light.</p>

<p>It doesn’t matter very much what invention you are
working on you ought to read a <i>first book</i> on <i>physics</i>
and one on <i>chemistry</i> and what’s more you should
study them if you expect to ever invent anything of
magnitude.</p>

<p>A book on physics tells all you need to know in
the beginning about matter, force, motion, the principles
of machines, the mechanics of liquids and gases,
electricity and magnetism, sound, heat and light.</p>

<p>Suppose you have an idea for an electrical device, if
you will read the chapters on electricity and magnetism
in your book of <i>physics</i> you will learn what you ought
to know first about these subjects and then if you need
to go deeper you can get a more advanced book.</p>

<p>A book of the elements of chemistry tells about gases,
acids, alkalies and metals and of their chemical
changes, and you will find a little knowledge of chemistry
of considerable use in working out many ideas.
There are many books of physics and chemistry but
<i>Avery’s Elements of Physics</i> published by the American
Book Company of New York, and <i>Remsen’s Elements
of Chemistry</i> published by Henry Holt and Company
of New York are good books for a beginner to
read.</p>

<p class="mt2" id="WORKING"><b>Working Out Ideas by Experiment.&mdash;</b>Though
you may think long and hard and read everything you
can find that has a bearing on your great idea, you will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
soon reach a point where you feel you would like to
try it out, that is to build it up in reality so that you
can see if it will do the work you want it to do or if it
won’t do the work where the trouble comes in.</p>

<p>Generally speaking if it is a mechanical or an electro-mechanical
scheme you begin by drawing this brain-child
of yours on paper and then you make a model,
or try to, and you add to it, take away from it, tear it
down sometimes and at others you scrap it and build
an entirely new one.</p>

<p>But usually it is some one part that needs patience
and effort and skill put upon it and as you try out
idea after idea, plan after plan and scheme after scheme
you are not only almost sure to find just what you are
looking for but very often experimental work will lead
you to fresh ideas for other and even more important
improvements.</p>

<p>Another curious thing I have found about experimenting
is this: you may start out on a certain line
and find that the result you want is so hard to get it
seems hopeless to go ahead. Now if you quit it is all
off but if you go on and on trying everything you can
think of, keeping up your belief that the thing you are
striving for must come and in your own ability to do
that which you want to do, after long hours, or days,
or weeks of constant work the result will come to you
like a flash and just as though the guardian angel of
invention hovered over you and put the desired thing
right into your mind and hand. The moral is that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
everything comes to the inventor who keeps on experimenting
and does not give up.</p>

<p class="mt2" id="INVENTIONS"><b>Ideas for Inventions in General.&mdash;</b>Inventions may
be divided into three general classes and these are (1)
<i>mechanical</i>, (2) <i>electrical</i> and (3) <i>chemical</i>; and there
are combinations of these classes as (a) <i>electro-mechanical</i>
and (b) <i>electro-chemical</i> inventions and your idea
may come under the head of any one of them.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class="mt2" id="MECH_INV"><b>Ideas for Mechanical Inventions.&mdash;</b>Inventions of
a mechanical kind include nearly everything in the
broad domain of physics but the term <i>mechanical inventions</i>
is applied especially to devices that are worked
by means of pendulums, springs, weights, levers,
wheels and axles, pulleys and inclined planes, screws
and pistons and which have to do with force and motion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>To work out an idea for a mechanical device if the
latter is a fairly simple one, as a printing press, see Fig.
3, or a scroll saw, see Fig. 4, should not be a very hard
thing to do because all of the parts can be easily seen
and if you add a few parts to it and it does not work
the fault can be readily picked and the part that is causing
the trouble can be redesigned and changed until
the whole device is made operative.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 4.</span>
<span class="smcap1">A VELOCIPEDE SCROLL SAW WITH BORING ATTACHMENT</span></div>
</div>

<p>Of course if the machine is a more complicated affair
in which there are pistons, valves and the like as in
an air-pump, see Fig. 5, or an ordinary engine, see Fig.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
6, it is liable to develop internal&mdash;or perhaps infernal
would be more fitting&mdash;troubles that are sometimes
very pertinacious and hard to overcome.</p>

<p>The easiest and best paying way to begin a career of
inventing is to hit on an idea to improve some simple
device that either makes for safety or for saving, for
convenience or for lessening mental or manual labor.
But if you should happen to get an idea for something
big and hard don’t give it the go-by, but follow it up
along the lines which I have indicated in this book and
you will stand a pretty good chance of finally working
it out to a successful conclusion.</p>

<p class="mt2" id="ELEC_INV"><b>Ideas for Electrical Inventions.&mdash;</b>Ideas for inventions
in which electricity and magnetism are used are
generally harder to work out than those of a purely
mechanical kind for the reason that the cause in the
first case which produces the result you want cannot be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
seen, whereas the cause in the second case which sets up
the effect you want is always visible.</p>

<p>But electrical inventions are like mechanical inventions
in that they may be very simple, such as passing a
current through the heating element of an electric
cooker as shown in Fig. 7, or it may be quite a complex
piece of apparatus as for instance a loud speaking
telephone for use on ship-board as shown in Fig. 8.</p>

<p>Where an electric current is used for some simple device
a thorough knowledge of electricity may not be
necessary but if your invention requires that a <i>low
voltage</i> current be changed into <i>high frequency oscillations</i>
which are in turn varied by the voice and these
oscillations are sent out from an <i>aerial wire</i>, all of
which is done in a wireless telephone, I should say
that you ought to have a pretty fair understanding of
the theory of electricity before you begin your experiments&mdash;that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
is if you expect to develop your invention
into an apparatus of utility and hence of worth.</p>

<p class="mt2" id="ELECTRO_INV"><b>Ideas for Electro-Mechanical Inventions.&mdash;</b>There
are many devices that are partly electrical and
partly mechanical, the <i>operation</i> of the one <i>actuating</i>
the other and the other way about.</p>

<p>The electric bell, see Fig. 9, and the telegraph
sounder, see Fig. 10, are types of simple electro-mechanical
devices, while the telautograph, see Fig. 11,
and the electrical gyroscopic compass for use on ship-board,
see Fig. 12, are examples of the more complex
electro-mechanical devices.</p>

<p>To work out an idea by bringing both mechanics and
electricity to bear in the same device often makes the
work much easier for sometimes the armature of an
<i>electromagnet</i> or the plunger of a <i>solenoid</i> will operate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
to a better advantage than a combination of levers.
But to use mechanics and electricity in the same device
you must of course have a knowledge of them
both.</p>

<p class="mt2" id="CHEM_INV"><b>Ideas for Chemical Inventions.&mdash;</b>There is another
class of ideas which require neither mechanics nor electricity
for their working out. They are chemical compounds.</p>

<p>Suppose an idea comes to you to make a chemical
solution for erasing ink, or to make a new high explosive.
While the idea might be a good one you
would have a long road to travel if you began experimenting
and had no knowledge of chemistry and your
road in the latter case would probably be straight up.</p>

<p>Trying out chemical compounds without knowing
something of the reactions they produce is far more
wasteful of time and money than puttering around with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
mechanical and electrical devices, especially when one’s
line of business is selling ribbons, and besides it’s more
or less dangerous too.</p>

<p>Should you get an idea for making an explosive
more powerful than any yet invented, either <i>dish</i> the
idea or pave the way by taking a course in advanced
chemistry and even then your idea is liable to perish
with you. Better let the Maxims or the du Ponts do
it.</p>

to prove your <i>priority</i>, that is that you were the first
in time to conceive the idea.</p>

<p>As soon as you have your idea all thought out and
have made a drawing, an experiment, a cardboard or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>

<p>Having shown, explained and enthused over it have
them go with you to a <i>notary public</i> and sign a statement
to the effect that they have seen it; then have him
put his signature and his seal on it. You have two
years from the date you first showed it to develop and
file an application for a patent on it but should you
fail to do this within the above time limit any one else
can take up your idea, if they know of it, work it up

you make in good black ink; draw pictures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>

WORKING IT OUT ON PAPER</h2>


<p>The next step after, and sometimes even before,
you have thought out your great idea is to make a
drawing of the invention it represents.</p>

<p>Nearly every one can do a little <i>free hand drawing</i>
and this is a good way to make rough sketches to aid
the mind in further developing thought.</p>

<p>But if you can make a simple <i>working drawing</i> of
your device, that is a picture in which all of the parts
are drawn in proportion, or to <i>scale</i> as it is called, the
whole thing will stand out clearly before you and you
can see where it is wrong and make the needed changes
on paper before you try to build a model.</p>

</div>

<p>To show the top, bottom, sides and ends of a box,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
or other device, you don’t need to draw out the whole
thing in perspective but you can make a flat, or plan
view of each part as shown at B, C and D in Fig. 15,
that is an outline drawing shown as though you were
looking squarely at it in the center and with the measurements
marked upon it.</p>

<p>If now you will make a set of these working drawings
of, say, a box and draw each part to <i>scale</i>, that
is measured off in proportion, as shown in B, C and D,
and saw out of a board the top, bottom, sides and ends
and nail them together you will have a box like that
shown in perspective at A.</p>

</div>

<p>Plan views are easy to draw because they are formed
of horizontal and vertical lines, and wheels are shown
as true circles. After making your plan views, though,
the safest way is to make a perspective drawing to the
same scale for when you are looking at a square object
as it really is it always appears larger than the plan
views would indicate. But this is ahead of the story.</p>

<p>Now suppose you wanted to show how the box would
look if it was sawed lengthwise through the middle.
You simply make a <i>cross-section</i> view of it as shown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
at E and any one who knows how to read drawings
will understand it. To show the hook on the front of
the box more clearly it can be drawn separately as at
F and this is called a <i>detail drawing</i>.</p>

<p>Exactly in the same way any device, apparatus or
machine can be shown by top, side and end views and
by <i>cross-section</i> and detail drawings.</p>

</div>

<p>Just to see how something a little more complicated
would work out on paper, let’s take the cylinder and
steam chest of a steam engine. First draw a side view
of these parts as shown in Fig. 16.</p>

<p>As the steam chest is a rectangle and every side of
it is flat it can be shaded by drawing fine parallel lines
spaced equally apart. The cylinder, pipes and rods
are round, or rather cylindrical, and to get this effect
these parts should be shaded with parallel lines
drawn close together beginning at the top and bottom
and making them ever farther apart as you get toward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
the middle and this will give it a rounded appearance.</p>

<p>Next draw the end view of the cylinder and steam-chest.
Since the cylinder has been given a diameter
of 3¼ inches in the side view, of course it must have
the same diameter in the end view as shown in Fig. 17.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 17.</span> <span class="smcap1">AN END VIEW OF A STEAM ENGINE</span></div>
</div>

<p>By looking again at Fig. 16 you will see that the
steam chest is 4½ inches long and that it is 2½ inches
high but it is in the end view Fig. 17, that the width
of it is shown. The end of the steam chest is shaded
with straight parallel evenly spaced lines and the cylinder
head is shaded with <i>concentric circles</i>, that is with
circles equally spaced apart and having the same center.</p>

<p>In this and many other cases a side view and an

sometimes a top view must also be made, and this is
shown in Fig. 18.</p>

how the inside is made. Suppose you had invented the
steam engine of course you would know how the inside
should be made and so you make a cross-sectional

construction and even the operation of the engine looms
up as though you had turned a searchlight on it.</p>

<p>Buy a quire of <i>isometric</i> (pronounced i-so-met´ric)
<i>cross-section paper</i> 6 by 9 inches, at a cost of 15 cents,
of any dealer in drawing materials. This paper is lined
in faint colored ink in three directions, as shown in
Fig. 22, and which represent length, breadth and
thickness.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Now <i>isometric</i> comes from <i>iso</i> which means <i>equal</i>
and <i>metric</i> which means <i>measure</i>, so isometric means
<i>equal measure</i> and the three lines used in isometric perspective
are at equal distances from each other. The
lines which cross the vertical lines on isometric cross-section
paper are 30 degrees from the base, or horizontal
line and the vertical line is, of course, 90 degrees
from the horizontal as shown in Fig. 23. Having
everything at hand suppose you try to draw a square<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
frame. Begin by making the first upright and you will
see by looking at Fig. 23 that all you have to do is to
draw three vertical lines and join the top and bottom
by marking over the 30 degree lines. This done draw
three more uprights in the same way and when you
have these on paper it is easy to put beams on top or
struts between them as shown at Fig. 24.</p>

<p>As all the lines are of equal measure you can mark
on the exact dimensions as shown in many of the isometric
perspective drawings in this book. For a drawing
of some device, or of a whole machine, to give to
some mechanic to make for you the better way is to
hand him a perspective drawing together with the top,
side and end views, rather than the latter views alone,
and then he will not need to figure out how they are
put together.</p>

</div>

<p>A protractor, as you may or may not know, is used<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
to lay off <i>angles</i> and to measure <i>angles</i> in <i>degrees</i>.
The curved part or scale of the protractor is divided
into 180 degrees since there are 360 degrees in a circle.
The figures start at both corners with 0 so that an
angle of any number of degrees right or left can be
marked off. Now the lines formed by marking off
angles of 30 degrees are the only ones you will have to
make for isometric perspective. To do this fasten a
sheet of paper to your drawing board with thumb tacks
at each corner and draw a straight line across the paper
near the bottom. Put your protractor on the edge
of the paper and the pencil line exactly as shown in
Fig. 27; lay your rule so that its edge crosses the
straight part of the protractor at the middle, marked A
in the drawing and also on the line of the scale of the
protractor marked 30 degrees and then draw a line on
the paper along the edge of your rule.</p>

lay your rule with its edge crossing the middle of the
straight part of the protractor as before and on the 30
degree line of the scale and so that when you draw the
line it will cross the other 30 degree line as shown in
Fig. 27.</p>

<p>If now you draw another line at 90 degrees, that is
vertically, between the two crossed lines, also as shown
in Fig. 27, each of the three lines will be exactly the
same distance apart in degrees. You can go ahead
now and draw lines ⅛ inch apart parallel with each of
the three lines and you will have a sheet of isometric
cross section paper of your own making.</p>

<p class="mt2" id="ISO_ELLIPSES"><b>How to Draw Isometric Ellipses.&mdash;</b><a id="EASY"></a><i>An Easy,
Rough Way.</i>&mdash;There is just one more little thing you
should know about making isometric perspectives and
that is how to draw disks, wheels and anything else
that is circular in form so that they will look right and
be right.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 28a.</span> <span class="smcap1">THE PROPORTION OF AN ISOMETRIC ELLIPSE</span></div>
</div>

<p>In isometric perspective everything that is round in
reality is drawn in the shape of an <i>ellipse</i>, that is a
closed curve that is longer than it is wide as shown at
A in Fig. 28; there are different shaped ellipses but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
there is only one used for isometric drawing and this
is always in the ratio of 1¼ to 2; that is if an ellipse is
2 inches long it will be 1¼ inches wide; an ellipse 4
inches long will be 2½ inches wide and so on.</p>

<p>An easy, though rough way to draw an isometric
ellipse is to make a line as long as the diameter of the
disk or wheel you intend to represent; draw another
line which is the width of the ellipse through the center
and at right angles across it, see A again and then
draw the curved line around the end of them free
hand.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 28b.</span> <span class="smcap1">HOW ELLIPSES STAND OUT IN RELIEF</span></div>
</div>

<p>How these ellipses are made to appear as if they
were set either in a vertical or a horizontal position
and at right angles to each other is shown at B in Fig.
28. The <i>axis</i>, that is the spindle, or shaft on which
the disk, or wheel, is mounted, must always follow the
30 degree line running at right angles to the edge of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
the board or whatever it is supposed to be fastened to
or goes through; and the thickness of the disk or wheel
is always shown on the same sides as the thickness of
the board or other part on which it is mounted, all of
which is brought out clearly at B in Fig. 28.</p>

<p class="mt2" id="HARD"><b>How to Draw an Isometric Ellipse.&mdash;</b><i>A Harder
but More Accurate Way.</i>&mdash;Begin by drawing a
straight line as long as you want the longest axis of
your ellipse to be, as shown at A B, Fig. 29. Divide
this line into four equal parts. Now take your compasses
and with the needle at the center of the line O
draw a circle having the line as its diameter.</p>

</div>

<p>Next start at A with your dividers and divide the
whole circle into ten equal parts and then take your
rule and draw a line from the point C on the circle
through the point G on the diameter and <i>produce</i>, or
extend it to the bottom of the circle; draw a line from
D through G and extend it to the top of the circle;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
draw a line from E through H and extend it to the
bottom of the circle when it will intersect the line C G
at the point J; and finally draw a line from F through
H to the top of the circle which will intersect the
line D G at I.</p>



<p>Take your compasses and using G as a center draw
the arc K A L; then using H as a center draw the
opposite arc M B N; using the point J as a center,
draw the arc K M so that its ends will meet the upper
ones of the end arcs perfectly; using the point I as a
center draw the fourth and last arc L N when the
ellipse is completed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>When making isometric ellipses much care must be
taken to make all the points and draw all the lines
with the greatest accuracy as the slightest error will
distort the whole thing.</p>

<p class="mt2" id="SHADE"><b>How to Shade Drawings.&mdash;</b>Besides the few hints
for shading perspective drawings which I have given
above there are certain ways to shade cross-sections

glass, wood, liquid, cork, carbon, insulation or other
materials. There are also different kinds of shading
to show fine and coarse fabrics and the various colors.</p>

case</i>, as the capitals and little letters are called, which
are used by mechanical draftsmen are also shown in

<p class="mt2" id="ELEC_SYMB"><b>How to Make Electrical Symbols.&mdash;</b>In making
drawings, either for yourself or for the patent office,
of electrical apparatus to show how it is connected up
you do not need to draw out a plan view or a perspective
of each part but you can make what are called
<i>symbols</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>Symbols are simply a few lines or signs that stand
for or represent a certain piece of apparatus; as an

you need to do is to make a couple of parallel lines,
one shorter and heavier than the other like this:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>To get the right proportions rule a sheet of paper
a couple of inches wide and about 8 inches long so
that the divisions will be ¹/₁₂ inch square and draw on
this the different parts of the manikin as shown at B
in Fig. 32. Now since every ¹/₁₂ inch on the paper is
equal to 1 inch for a man 6 feet tall your manikin will
be 6 inches high when it is jointed and complete.</p>

<p class="mt2" id="CARDBOARD_MODELS"><b>Making Cardboard Models.&mdash;</b>In drawing out your
invention you will often find that you can’t get the
image you have in your mind’s eye down on paper.</p>

<p>There may be the movement of a lever, the turning
of a wheel or the motion of a cam that you cannot
quite see through and try as you will to work it out on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
paper the thing refuses to materialize. Under such
conditions it would be a great waste of time and
money to set about building a real model but there is
an easy way out of the difficulty and that is to make
a cardboard model of the device.</p>

<p>Just as an illustration take the case of an aeroplane.
Say that your big idea is a scheme for controlling the
<i>elevating planes</i> and the <i>direction rudder</i>; you have
clearly in mind the use of an elevating plane on each
side of the rudder and yet when you try to draw it out
these two parts won’t fit together at all as you expected
them to do.</p>

<p>When you reach this point get a sheet of heavy
cardboard, shears, bottle of liquid glue, pins, matches
or toothpicks, some thin wire, a few corks and a sharp
knife.</p>

<p>Out of these materials you can build up the <i>fuselage</i>,
as the body of the aeroplane is called; next you
can fasten on the rudder and then the elevation planes;
and when you have the tail-planes put together with
real materials and actual shapes and sizes they will
stand out in bold relief and you will have no trouble
in making your drawings from the cardboard model.</p>

<p>Or suppose you have an idea for a gyro-motor such
as are used for driving aeroplanes. Now in this motor
the shaft to which the pistons are fastened stands still
and the cylinders in which the pistons move revolve.
It is rather a curious motion and not easy for a fellow
who is not posted on mechanics to grasp offhand.</p>

<p>What’s the thing to do? Why, make a cardboard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
model of the mechanism using pins for the shafts and
you will have a model that will look like Fig. 33, and
when you turn the cardboard disk with the cylinders
marked on it you will see at once exactly how the motor
works.</p>

<h2 id="CHAP_III">CHAPTER III<br />
THE STATE OF THE ART</h2>


<p>Taking it for granted, now, that you have drawn
out your invention on paper and have made cardboard
models of the more difficult parts so that you can see
about what your device or machine will look like and
how it will work your next move is to look up the
<i>state of the art</i>.</p>

<p class="mt2" id="STATE_ART"><b>What is Meant by State of the Art.&mdash;</b>The state
of the art means everything that has been published
either in books, papers, or in patents about anything
that has been discovered or invented, which has a bearing
on your invention.</p>

<p>As an instance the <i>state of the art</i> of the <i>dynamo
electric machine</i>, or <i>dynamo</i> as it is called for short,
goes clear back to 1833 when Faraday made the experiment
of passing a wire across the pole of a magnet
and found that a current of electricity was set up in it&mdash;that
is in the wire. Since that time hundreds of
patents have been taken out and thousands of articles
have been written about dynamos.</p>

<p>All of this information, or <i>data</i> as it is called, goes
to make up the state of the art in the class of dynamos
and all of the patents can be had and many of the
articles too if you know how to go about it to find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
them and one of the purposes of this chapter is to tell
you how to do it.</p>

<p class="mt2" id="USE_STATE"><b>Use of the State of the Art.&mdash;</b>You can easily understand
that with all the thought that has been given
to, and the experimental work that has been put on,
dynamos to the end of bettering them it is a pretty
hard thing to make an improvement that has not been
made before, though it is still quite possible to do so.</p>

<p>Suppose, then, you had thought of and worked out
on paper some improvement on the dynamo which you
believed to be new and original and of great value.
Certainly since you know that inventors like Edison,
Brush, Weston, Thompson, Tesla, and a hundred other
men almost as big, had applied themselves with diligence
to dynamo problems during the last 40 years
you would not care to go very far in spending your
time or your money working on it until you learned
whether or not some one before you had thought of
and used the same <i>principle</i>.</p>

<p>Yet hundreds of beginners in the field of inventing
work along in the dark because they do not know the
state of the art, and always to their sorrow. So don’t
be one of them.</p>

<p class="mt2" id="LEARN_STATE"><b>How to Learn the State of the Art.&mdash;</b>For the
reasons I have given above you will see that it is bad
practice to go beyond the point of working out your
invention on paper before you know whether it is
really new or not for though it may be entirely original
with you, if it has been thought of and read before
some learned body of scientists, or printed in some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
musty trade paper prior to the time you conceived the
idea you haven’t the slightest claim to it, nor is it of
the least value to you.</p>

<p>And so after you have thought out your invention
and have made drawings of it the next step <i>is not</i> to
apply for a patent as most patent attorneys will advise
to do, or to have a model made as many model makers
will tell you to do but <i>to look up the state of the art</i>
and see where you are <i>at</i>.</p>

<p class="mt2" id="HAVING"><b>Having a Patent Attorney Look it Up.&mdash;</b>The
easiest and quickest way to learn roughly the state of
the art is to have a <i>preliminary search</i>, as it is called,
made by a <i>patent attorney</i>, which means that he will
look through the files of patents that have been granted
by the <i>United States Patent Office</i> to other inventors
for devices or machines of the kind you are working
on.</p>

<p>To do this you must, of course, <i>retain</i> a patent attorney,
that is employ him, and turn the drawings and
written description of your invention over to him.
Every patent attorney outside of Washington, where
the patent office is located, has a <i>correspondent</i> or an
associate, that is another patent attorney, who lives
there and who acts for him when necessary.</p>

<p>This latter patent attorney will take your drawings
and description to the library of the patent office, look
over the files of patents there and pick out those which
seem to him are most nearly like your invention.</p>

<p>He will get copies of these patents, send them to
your patent attorney who will in turn hand them to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
you with your original drawings and you can then go
over them and compare them and judge for yourself
whether you have a really new invention or if it burned
in the brain of some other inventor before you ever
dreamed of it.</p>

<p>From the above you might infer that it would be
a good scheme to employ a patent attorney who lives in
Washington; but on the contrary it is better to have a
patent attorney in your own city transact this business
for you, if one is to be had, for then you can talk
with him and you will learn many things you couldn’t
begin to find out through correspondence.</p>

<p>Many advertising patent attorneys agree to make
what they are pleased to call a <i>free search</i> for you&mdash;and
do it while you wait, so to speak. A free search,
or <i>desk search</i>, as it is dubbed by those who don’t make
them, is of no value whatever for it is the snap-shot
opinion, or rather a notion, of a patent attorney who
is drumming up business by un-business like methods.</p>

<p>To show how absurd an opinion of this kind is just
consider that there are 43 <i>divisions</i> of inventions in
the patent office; each division, is split up into anywhere
from a dozen to nearly 200 <i>classes</i> and that in
some of these classes as many as 12,000 patents have
been granted as in the case of the sewing machine.</p>

<p>And when you ask a patent attorney of this ilk to
make a free search for you he will write back a letter
in this tone of voice: I have very carefully considered
your <i>sketch</i>, etc., etc. The first payment of fees necessary
to start your case is $20 and upon receipt of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
amount I will be very glad to carry the case forward,
etc., etc.</p>

<p>All patent attorneys who advertise that they will
make a search for you free of charge will also make
what they call a <i>special search</i> for which they charge
$5.00, and any other patent attorney will make one for
the same price and which is, after all is said and done,
only a <i>preliminary search</i>.</p>

<p>You can buy a copy of any patent that has been
<i>issued</i> by sending 5 cents in coin&mdash;the government
won’t take its own stamps&mdash;to the <i>Commissioner of
Patents, Washington, D. C.</i>, that is if you know the
number and date of it and the name of the inventor to
whom it was granted. The patent attorney who makes
the preliminary search will send you several copies of
the patents nearest like your drawing without extra
charge as these are, or should be, included in your $5.00
fee.</p>

<p>When you get the copies of these patents go over
each one carefully and see how nearly the pictures are
like yours; then read the description of the invention,
or <i>specification</i> as it is called, and compare it with your
own statement, and, finally study the <i>claims</i> at the end
of the specification and pick them to pieces for in these
are to be found what has really been allowed to the
inventor by the patent office.</p>

<p>The patents found by the patent attorney in making
a preliminary search of the files and which are sent to
you does not by any means represent the whole state
of the art, but they serve a useful purpose as a starter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
The reason it is not complete is because the patents are
usually selected by patent attorneys in virtue of their
similarity to the drawings you have submitted to him.
Sometimes, to be sure, he reads what the specification
says and if he is a real good patent attorney he will
sift out a few of the claims, though this is usually due
to his patent training rather than to any conscientious
desire on his part to get at all the facts in the case.</p>

<p>But when you have applied for a patent on your
alleged new and useful improvement and it is being
scrutinized by the <i>examiner</i> in the patent office, he will
look up the state of the art in all its devious <i>ramifications</i>
for this is what he is paid to do by the people of
the United States, though he thinks it is the officials
in Washington who employ him. At any rate he has
plenty of time to do it in and ample assistance to do
it with.</p>

<p>Nor does he merely take a glance at the drawings,
specifications and claims of your patent application and
compare them casually with others that have been
granted along the same line of endeavor, but, instead,
when enough pressure is brought to bear, he will look
up everything that has ever been published in all languages,
including the barbaric <i>ro</i>,<span class="fnanchor"><a href="#FN_1" id="FNA_1">[1]</a></span> since Adam was a
boy.</p>

<p>At other times and for no reason at all, or so it
seems, he will of a verity go to sleep on the job in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
sub-cellar and let an application slip through his
room in a few months, while he will spend years on another
application of the same kind. Of course if you
are the fortunate one you will be glad to get a patent
granted so easily; your patent attorney is glad because
he has your money in his pocket and the examiner is
glad because he has made a friend of his glad.</p>

<p>To have everybody glad is a nice thing, you will allow,
but don’t crow too soon for there is a hole in the
average patent big enough to drive a horse and wagon
through. If your patent is for an invention of genuine
merit you will not be alone very long in the field
and should you commence to make anything that looks
like real money out of it you will find some other
genius with an invention and a patent, as like yours
as the other Siamese twin and if you don’t sue him
he will sue you and then you can fight it out in the
courts.</p>

<p>Even as right is always on the side of the army with
the heaviest artillery, if there are enough shells, so, too,
justice is always on the side of the inventor who has
the smoothest patent attorney and the cleverest experts
if they have enough ammunition in the way of some
claims. While it requires skill to draw up good claims
they can in any case be made better where the state of
the art is known by yourself and your patent attorney.</p>

<p class="mt2" id="YOURSELF"><b>How to Look It Up Yourself.&mdash;</b>Whatever the
nature of the invention you are working on you should
read up its history from its earliest beginnings and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
this age of papers, books and public libraries this is an
easy, entertaining and profitable thing to do.</p>

<p>As an illustration take the art of flying and let’s suppose
you are working on a new <i>wing</i>, or <i>main-plane</i>,
for an aëroplane; if you will go over the list of books
sold by book publishers, or consult the catalogue of a
public library you will find books on flying, or <i>aviation</i>
as it is called, that will give you a full account of the
development of flying machines; and if you will get
the right book it will picture and describe all the forms
of wings that have been invented and patented up to
the time the book went to press. Then there are
weekly and monthly papers published which are devoted
entirely to the theory and practice of flying and
by reading these you will be able to keep right up to
the <i>entering edge</i> of the art.</p>

<p>Now what I have said about flying is just as true of
whatever else you may happen to be working on, for
books and papers are printed and published about nearly
every subject you can think of, from aviation to wireless
telegraphy; by reading up on the subject of and allied
to your invention you will soon have the history
of it by heart and this makes up a large part of the state
of the art.</p>

<p>Another and fortunate thing when you look up
the state of the art a lot of other ideas will surge helter-skelter
through your mind and if you are careful to
write them down many of them will be of much value
to you in the furtherance of your invention.</p>

<p>If you live in a large city it is an easy matter to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
look up the patents that have been granted for inventions
in your class, for you will find an <i>Index of the
Patent Office</i> in the public library which gives the number
and date of the patent you want and the <i>patentee’s
name</i>. The <i>Index</i> is published every year by the
Unites States patent office and it gives the alphabetical
list of the patentees and of the inventors to whom patents
were granted for that year.</p>

<div id="FIG_34_35_36" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_b_053.jpg" width="450" height="262" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 34.</span> <span class="smcap1">THE OFFICIAL GAZETTE</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Fig. 35.</span> <span class="smcap1">PATENT SPECIFICATIONS</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Fig. 36.</span> <span class="smcap1">INDEX TO PATENTS</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Having found the patent you want to look into, get
the <i>Official Gazette</i> of the patent office for the same
year and by looking up the number, or patentee, or invention,
or all of them, you can easily locate an <i>excerpt</i>
of the patent and then you can take a look at the drawing
and read the principal claims.</p>

<p>The <i>Official Gazette</i> is published every week by the
patent office and it contains a picture and a brief description
of each patent issued for that week, together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
with the number and date of the patent, the name of the
patentee and of the invention.</p>

<p>Should you require more information about a patent
than is given in the <i>Gazette</i> you can look up a copy of
the patent, or <i>full specification</i> as it is called, and these
are bound in handsome volumes of 100 patents each, or
at least, this is the practice of the New York Public
Library.</p>

<p>In every library that has a <i>patent section</i>, that is a
part devoted to patents, there is a librarian in charge
who will either find any patent you want or who will
show you how to use the <i>Index</i>, <i>Official Gazette</i> and the
volumes of the <i>full specifications</i>.</p>

<p>The patent attorneys in Washington have things
much easier as all of the patents are bound in books according
to the class they are in and they only need to
look over the volumes of a given class to choose those
they want.</p>

<p>When you have learned everything you can from
books, papers and copies of patents already granted
about the subject you are interested in you will have a
pretty clear idea of the state of the art and whether you
are working in a virgin field or one that has been sown
with the same kind of inventions by others.</p>

<p>But there is another and most important part of the
state of the art which neither you nor your patent attorneys
can find out about until after you have filed
your application for a patent; this is the information
contained in the applications for patents by other inventors
before your application was filed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>Should another application <i>disclose</i> either in whole
or in part an invention like, or nearly like, yours, or
rather that your invention is like, or nearly like, some
one’s else, the patent examiner declares what is called
an <i>interference</i>, of which more will be said in another
chapter, and this gives the patent attorneys on both
sides another chance to rake in a few more fees.</p>

<p class="mt2" id="IMPROVEMENTS"><b>What to Do When You Find There Are No
Other Improvements Like Yours.&mdash;</b>After you have
looked up, or have had looked up, the state of the art
as carefully as possible, and you are satisfied that your
invention, or improvement, is different from everything
else you have been able to find, you should by all means
go ahead and make such experiments, or build a working
model, as the case may be, in order that you may
know that all you have thought about it is really true.</p>

<p>As soon as your experiments are completed or your
model is finished so that you know exactly what you
want to <i>claim</i> as being strictly new and novel and original
with you, then you are in shape to hire a patent
attorney to draw up your patent application and file it
and don’t do the latter a moment before.</p>

<p>A patent application based largely on what you <i>guess</i>,
is a patent when granted without value for it can no
more cover the exact facts in the case when these are
finally worked out than a description one might write
about an imaginary trip to Europe would be likely to
fit the true details of a real trip which he would make
sometime thereafter.</p>

<p class="mt2" id="RESEMBLANCE"><b>When You Find There is a Resemblance.&mdash;</b>Very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
often you will find after you have looked up the state of
the art that some other inventor has patented a device
that seems on the face of it quite like yours and yet
when you examine them critically, compare them
closely and bring thought to bear upon them you will be
able to distinguish a difference and often in several respects.</p>

<p>Sometimes this difference, though it seems to be
small, is a mighty one when it comes to producing results
as for instance when Elias Howe used a needle
with the eye near its point instead of in its head and so
made the sewing machine a commercial success. And
yet a patent examiner of to-day would not be likely to
see any difference in a needle with an eye in its head
and one with an eye near its point, that is, if he had
never seen either one before.</p>

<p>If you have made a machine to do a certain thing and
you find that another machine has been invented that
does the same thing and in the same way you may be
able to change the mechanical movements, or electrical
devices, until you are able to get the same or a better
result by other and better means. It is all very easy
to tell you to do this but in practice it is often a mighty
hard thing to accomplish.</p>

<p>The Bell telephone is an example of such difficulties,
for while both transmitters and receivers can be made
which work on principles quite different from those
now in use the results are not nearly as good and hence
the inventions have no practical value.</p>

<p class="mt2" id="EXACTLY"><b>When Others Are Exactly Like Yours.&mdash;</b>But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
when you find that your great idea has been thought of
and worked out and patented by some other inventor
ahead of you and that both the cause and effect
which you and he arrived at are the same, then the
best thing to do is to drop it like a hot potato and invent
something else.</p>

<p class="small9"><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;The Patent Office publishes a <i>Manual of Classification</i>,
price $1, which lists all of the sub-divisions of each
class. Take as an illustration <i>Explosives</i>, which is <i>Class 53</i>.
This is subdivided into six such classes, namely: (1) Blasting
Powder; (2) Fulminates; (3) Nitro Compounds; (4)
Gun Powder; (5) Matches; (6) Pyrotechnic Compounds.</p>

<h2 id="CHAP_IV">CHAPTER IV<br />
HOW TO EXPERIMENT</h2>


<p>The kind of experimenting you will do will, of
course, depend altogether on the nature of the invention
on which you are working.</p>

<p>But, as good fortune would have it if you are not
mechanically inclined you are not apt to hit upon a
mechanical invention. And if you know nothing of
electricity, you are not likely to think out an improved
electrical device.</p>

<p>But this much is certain if you are going to experiment
the right way you must know something about
the right way to experiment. No one should expect to
work out to a successful conclusion a new machine or
apply a new improvement to an old machine if he
knows nothing of the <i>first principles of mechanics</i> or
<i>about mechanical movements</i>, and by rights he ought
to have some knowledge of <i>machine design</i>.</p>

<p>And the above statement is just as true of electrical
inventions. A worker who does not know the difference
between a binding post and an alternating current
need not expect to progress very far with an invention
of, say, an electric block signal system&mdash;unless he calls
in an expert to help him; but what he should do is to
study the principles of electricity and magnetism, learn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
the various currents that can be used and what apparatus
and instruments are needed for utilizing these currents.</p>

<p>The same thing applies to inventions in chemistry in
that to work intelligently you must know about the
properties of substances, chemical change and acids,
bases and salts. And with electro-chemistry both a
knowledge of chemistry and electricity are needed.</p>

<p>It is easy to see that it would not be possible in the
limited space I have here to say more than a word or
two about the subjects of mechanics, electricity, chemistry
and electro-chemistry when each requires a whole
chapter to explain it even in a rough way and a whole
book to explain it thoroughly. But there are a few
things I can tell you about them that will put you on
the right track and then I shall give you the names of
some books that will be of great service to you when
you are in need of them, and with your help we’ll make
a real inventor of you.</p>

<p class="mt2" id="HOW_EXPERIMENT"><b>How to Experiment with Machines.&mdash;</b>Any one
who possesses the slightest bent for mechanics can work
out improvements on devices like egg-beaters and monkey-wrenches
and feel their way as they go along.</p>

<p>But when it comes to designing and building real
machines where numerous levers, gears, and springs are
combined to make a working unit you should by all
means read up on the subjects of <i>work, energy and
power</i>, learn about the <i>six mechanical powers</i>&mdash;and
the action of machines in general. The following definitions
will give you an idea about all of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p class="mt2" id="WORK_ENERGY"><b>Work, Energy and Power.&mdash;</b>A wheel will not turn
of its own accord but if it is moved round by some
<i>force</i> applied to it such as the hand, a coiled spring or
a motor, <i>work</i> is done. In fact whenever a thing is
made to change its position work is done.</p>

<p>The power to do work is caused by <i>energy</i>; energy
is developed when some force is applied and can be
stored up in bodies as when a ball is thrown. When
the energy stops acting, or is used up, there can no
longer be any work done. Energy can be <i>transferred</i>
from one body to another, as from a clock-spring to a
wheel, or from one wheel to another wheel; and energy
can be <i>transformed</i>, as the chemical energy of a battery
into the rotary energy of a motor or from steam
into mechanical motion.</p>

<p>The <i>unit of work</i> is the <i>foot-pound</i> and this is the
work done to raise <i>one pound one foot high</i>. The <i>rate</i>
of doing work is the <i>horse power</i> and a horse power is
equal to lifting 550 foot-pounds in a second, or 33,000
foot-pounds in a minute.</p>

<p>Energy may be either <i>potential</i> or <i>kinetic</i>; <i>potential
energy</i> means energy that is stored up and with nothing
to act on, and for this reason it is called <i>energy of position</i>.
The electric charge of a Leyden jar is potential
energy but the moment it is released it makes a spark
and becomes <i>kinetic energy</i> or <i>energy of motion</i>. Potential
energy can be changed into kinetic energy and
kinetic energy back again into potential energy with
amazing freedom. Energy has a definite relation to
<i>velocity</i> which means that when the speed of a moving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
body is increased its power to do work is also increased.</p>

<p>Like matter, energy cannot be destroyed, and so all
of it taken together is called a <i>constant quantity</i>.
When the energy stored up in a spring, or a battery,
has been used the energy is not destroyed, though it
may be very hard to find out where it has gone, but you
may know that it has vanished in heat and in other
forms of energy.</p>

<p class="mt2" id="WORK_FRICTION"><b>Work Against Friction.&mdash;</b>The chief resistance
which machines have to overcome is caused by <i>friction</i>.
Since there is no such thing as a perfectly smooth surface
friction is always present in machines and much
energy must be spent in overcoming it. The energy
wasted by friction is not destroyed but is transformed
into another kind of energy and that is heat. When a
marble is rolled over the surface of a table there is less
friction between the two than when the marble slides
across the table. Hence with <i>ball bearings</i> there is less
friction than with <i>cone bearings</i>. (See <a href="#APP_I">Appendix I</a>.)</p>

<p class="mt2" id="FORMS_ENERGY"><b>Forms of Energy.&mdash;</b>There are nine forms of
energy that you can make use of in your experiments
and in your inventions, and these are:</p>

<table class="table1" summary="forms of energy">
<tr>
<td class="tdc br" rowspan="4"><span class="smcap">Energy of Masses</span></td>

<p class="mt2" id="MACHINES"><b>Machines and the Principles of Machinery.&mdash;</b>A
<i>machine</i> is a contrivance of mechanical parts by which
energy is transferred from one part to another. Beside
the amount of energy required for doing useful
work there must be an extra amount for overcoming
the friction. Remember that no machine can either
create energy or increase it, and, as you have seen,
every machine wastes some energy in friction; this being
true it must be clear then that it is impossible to
make a machine which when once set in motion would
continue to run forever, or at least until its parts were
worn out. So don’t waste <i>your energy</i> in trying to
invent a <i>perpetual motion</i> machine.</p>

<p class="mt2" id="USES_MACHINES"><b>The Uses of Machines.&mdash;</b>These are many and
varied from a commercial point of view in that they
are designed to do better, faster or cheaper work and
sometimes all of these good qualities are found in a
single machine.</p>

<p>From a mechanical point of view, though, a machine
is used to</p>

<p>(1) Change one form of energy into another form,
as steam into electricity.</p>

<p>(2) To make a slow moving, but powerful force
produce a high speed or velocity, as in a sewing machine.</p>

<p>(3) To change a small, fast moving force into a
powerful force, as in the action of a crowbar.</p>

<p>(4) To change the direction of a force so that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
power can be applied where and when it is needed, and</p>

<p>(5) To make use of whatever force is at hand as
the strength of animals, wind, water, steam, gas and
electricity.</p>

<p class="mt2" id="SIX_POWERS"><b>The Six Mechanical Powers.&mdash;</b>As a matter of fact
there are really only two of these, namely the <i>lever</i>
and the <i>inclined plane</i>, the other four, that is the
<i>wheel</i> and <i>axle</i>, the <i>pulley</i>, the <i>wedge</i> and the <i>screw</i>
being simply modified forms of the first two.</p>

<p>The <i>lever</i> is a rigid bar resting on, and which can be

are three classes of levers and these are:</p>

treadle of a jig saw and sugar tongs are levers of this
class. See B, Fig. 39. Then there is the <i>bent lever</i>,
as shown in Fig. 40, where the power and load do not
act parallel with each other, and the <i>compound lever</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
which takes the place of a single long lever as shown in

<p>The <i>wheel</i> and <i>axle</i> is really a form of lever and fulcrum.
The axle provides a continuous fulcrum as
shown in Fig. 42. Trains of wheel work, such as are
used in clocks and other mechanical devices, are used<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
to change a slow moving powerful force into a high

<p>The <i>pulley</i> is a wheel with a cord, rope or belt running
round it as shown in Fig. 44. It is used to transmit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
power and also to change the direction of it. A
pulley can be either fixed or movable. A <i>compound
pulley</i> makes it possible to raise a heavy weight with a
very small force, not by increasing the energy, but by
transposing <i>velocity</i> into <i>power</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>inclined plane</i> is any hard smooth surface set
at a slant to the force to be overcome. A barrel can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
be rolled up an inclined plane against the force of
gravity, as shown in Fig. 45, while it could not be
lifted straight up to the same height.</p>

<p>The <i>wedge</i> is simply an inclined plane on a small
scale. It is useful where a great force must be exerted
through a small distance, as in splitting a stick
of wood, as shown in Fig. 46.</p>

<p>A <i>screw</i> is also a modified form of an inclined plane.
By means of a screw great pressures can be exerted
in a small space and here again a powerful force is had
with a corresponding loss of velocity. It is shown in

<p class="mt2" id="COMPOUND_MACHINES"><b>Compound Machines.&mdash;</b>Any of the above six
simple machines can be combined with any or all of
the others and every machine that has ever been invented
for any purpose is made up of a combination of
these six mechanical powers.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of invention there has been
made by combining these six mechanical powers in
different ways, a large number of simple machines
called <i>mechanical movements</i>; and there has not been
a single new mechanical movement invented in many
years.</p>

<p>Hence when you begin to work on your machine
don’t waste time and energy trying to devise the mechanical
movement you need, or what is still more
foolish attempting to invent a new mechanical movement
but look at the pictures in Fig. 48 which gives
over 60 of the most useful mechanical movements.
If you cannot find one among them that will do the
work then look for it in Gardner D. Hiscock’s book of
<i>Mechanical Movements</i> which gives them all.</p>

<p class="mt2" id="BOOKS"><b>Books.&mdash;</b>And it would be a good idea for you to
read one of the following books which you can, most

<p>With the first principles of mechanics well in mind
and the mechanical movements I have given, you can go
on with your experiments in a safe and sensible way.</p>

<p class="mt2" id="EXPERIMENT_ELEC"><b>How to Experiment with Electricity.&mdash;</b><i>Electricity</i>
is very much like mechanics in that any one can
put up an electric bell or screw in a plug-fuse but to
experiment and build an apparatus in which electricity
and magnetism are the powers used you must know
how electricity is generated, how magnetism is produced,
the different forms of electricity that are available
and finally the kinds of apparatus best suited for
the work that is required of them.</p>

<p class="mt2" id="FORMS_ELEC"><b>Forms of Electricity.&mdash;</b>Though there is only one
kind of electricity it can be divided into four classes,
or forms, and these are:</p>

<p>(1) Electricity at rest, or <i>static electricity</i>, that is
electricity stored up but not active as in a charged Leyden
jar.</p>

<p>(2) Electricity in locomotion, or <i>current electricity</i>,
in which electricity flows along wires, through solutions
and other conductors when it is able to do
work.</p>

<p>(3) Electricity in rotation, or <i>magnetism</i> in which
electric whirls produce attraction and repulsion, and:</p>

<p>(4) Electricity in vibration, or <i>radiation</i> in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
electric charges moving to and fro millions of times a
second set up waves in the <i>ether</i> which our eyes can
see and which we call <i>light</i>. Then there are waves
much too short for the eye to see and these are called
<i>ultra-violet</i> waves; there are waves too long for the
eye to see and these are the <i>infra-red</i> waves which we
can feel for they are <i>heat</i> waves, and finally there are
very long waves set up in the ether by surging <i>high
frequency</i> currents in wires and these are called <i>electric</i>
or wireless waves.<span class="fnanchor"><a href="#FN_2" id="FNA_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p class="mt2" id="STATIC_ELEC"><b>Static Electricity.&mdash;</b>You can think of electricity
as being a fluid, like water, for it has both <i>quantity</i> and
<i>pressure</i>, and in many ways it acts like a fluid.</p>

<p>If you filled a tank, raised above the ground, with
water, the latter would be at rest, but it would be under
pressure too and the moment a hole was bored in any
part of the tank below the level of the water it would
squirt out; in other words the <i>potential water</i> would
be changed into <i>kinetic</i> water or water in locomotion.
If, now, you charge a <i>Leyden jar</i>, or a <i>condenser</i>, with
electricity it will be at rest until you bring the alternate
coatings of tin-foil closely together when a spark will
result and a current will flow.</p>

<p>Static electricity is generated by <i>friction</i> and by
<i>induction</i>, but the electricity so produced is very small
in quantity and very high in pressure. A Leyden
jar, or other condenser can be charged, though, with a
low pressure current of electricity, as in a <i>spark coil</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p class="mt2" id="CURRENT_ELEC"><b>Current Electricity.&mdash;</b>Whenever electricity flows
in a wire, or other conductor, it acts like water flowing
through a pipe and it is then called <i>current electricity</i>.
The two most common ways to generate a current of
electricity is by means of a <i>chemical battery</i> and by a
<i>dynamo electric machine</i>.</p>

<p>A current of electricity may have a small <i>current
strength</i>, as its quantity is called, and a high <i>voltage</i>,
as its pressure is called, like the discharge of a Leyden
jar, or it may have a large current strength and a low
voltage, as a current generated by a battery.</p>

<p>A <i>direct current</i>, see Fig. 49, is a current which
flows steadily in one direction and this can be generated
by a battery or a dynamo. An <i>interrupted current</i>,
see Fig. 50, is a current that is <i>made</i> and <i>broken</i>
a number of times a minute and this is usually done by
a <i>vibrator</i>, or <i>interruptor</i> as it is often called. A <i>pulsating
current</i>, see Fig. 51, is one whose current
strength is varied. One way to produce a pulsating
current is to talk into a <i>telephone transmitter</i> which is
connected with a battery.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>An <i>alternating current</i>, see Fig. 52, is one which
flows first in one direction and then in the other direction.
A <i>magneto-electric machine</i> and an <i>alternating
current generator</i> are the means for generating this
form of current. Alternating current can be produced
from a direct current by using an <i>induction coil</i>, or
<i>spark coil</i> as it is called. But a steady direct current
can be obtained from an alternating current only by
coupling an <i>alternating current motor</i> to a <i>direct current</i>
dynamo.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 52.</span> <span class="smcap1">AN ALTERNATING CURRENT</span></div>
</div>

<p>The pressure, or voltage, of an alternating current
can be <i>stepped up</i> or <i>stepped down</i>, that is, raised or
lowered, by means of a <i>transformer</i>, which is the
simplest form of induction coil. The current strength
varies proportionately with the charges in pressure so
that there can never be any increase in the total amount
of energy but there is always a loss of energy due to
heating and other causes. The moral again is that an
electrically driven perpetual motion machine is a delusion
and a snare. Alternating current can be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
changed into <i>interrupted direct current</i>, see Fig. 53, by
an <i>electrolytic rectifier</i> or a <i>mercury vapor tube</i>.</p>

DIRECT CURRENT</span></div>
</div>

<p>A <i>high tension current</i> is an alternating current of
sufficient pressure to make a <i>jump-spark</i>; it can be produced
by a <i>high-tension magneto</i>, or a <i>spark coil</i>. An
alternating current is generally considered one that
changes its direction less than 100,000 times a second;
when it changes its direction 100,000 times or more a
second it is called an <i>oscillating current</i>, see Fig. 54,
or a <i>high frequency current</i>, and this is the form of
current that is used for sending out <i>wireless waves</i>.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 54.</span> <span class="smcap1">A PERIODIC OSCILLATING CURRENT</span></div>
</div>

<p>The only known way to set up oscillating currents
of really high frequency is by discharging the stored up
electricity of a condenser, or its equivalent, through a
circuit of small resistance by means of a spark, or an
arc. The latter sets up sustained oscillations as shown
in Fig. 55. <i>High frequency alternators</i> (machines)
have been built which generate alternating currents of
over 100,000 <i>cycles</i> per second.</p>

</div>

<p class="mt2" id="MAGN"><b>Magnetism.&mdash;</b>A bar of steel can be made
magnetic by rubbing it on a <i>permanent steel magnet</i> or
on an <i>electromagnet</i>, or winding a number of turns of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
wire around it and passing a current through the
wire.</p>

<p>If a bar of soft iron is placed in a coil of wire and a
current is made to flow round it the iron will become a
magnet but remains so only while the current is flowing,
and this forms an <i>electromagnet</i>. An electromagnet
works best on a direct current but an alternating
current can also be used to energize it.</p>

<p>A coil of wire with an <i>air core</i>, that is without either
an iron or a steel core, becomes a magnet when a current
is made to flow through it. If, now, one end of
a bar of soft iron is slipped into the hole in the coil
of wire and the current is turned on the iron bar,
or core, will be drawn into it. This kind of a magnet
is called a <i>plunger electromagnet</i>, or <i>solenoid</i>.</p>

<p class="mt2" id="RADIATION"><b>Radiation.&mdash;</b>Whenever you light a match, or make
a light by any other means, electric charges on the
molecules of the substance which is heated vibrate violently
to and fro and the minute surgings of the electric
charges set up <i>electro-magnetic</i> waves in the <i>ether</i>
which the eye can see and the brain can sense and
this is what we call <i>light</i>.</p>

<p>When some substances are intensely heated, as for
instance, the <i>carbons</i> of an <i>arc lamp</i>, waves are also
sent out which are too short for the eye to see but
which will nevertheless affect a photographic plate.
These are called <i>ultra-violet waves</i>. The <i>infra-red</i>
waves are too long for the eye to see but the nerves
of our bodies sense them as heat.</p>

<p>In conclusion take this bit of advice: don’t try to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
invent a new kind of electric current and don’t try to
devise a new <i>electro-mechanical movement</i> for in
either case you will waste your time. Every form of
current and every kind of electro-mechanical device
you will need for any machine which you may invent
are at hand and ready for use. Fig. 56 shows a number
of electro-mechanical devices and these will aid
you in getting the result you want.</p>

<p class="mt2" id="HOW_TO_CHEM"><b>How to Experiment with Chemistry.&mdash;</b>It is a
pleasant pastime to make chemical experiments
after a known formula but it is quite a different
and a difficult thing to try to invent some new chemical
compound when you know little or nothing of chemistry.</p>

<p>If your invention calls for some <i>chemical combination</i>
or <i>decomposition</i> or <i>double decomposition</i>&mdash;these
are the three kinds of chemical action&mdash;get an
elementary book on chemistry and study it until you
really know it and then you will have a bed-rock foundation
on which to build up your invention.</p>

<p>You may say it is all very well to read a book on
chemistry and learn all about it but it’s a mighty hard
thing to do without a teacher. My answer is if you
are not interested in chemistry, you will certainly find
the study of it up-hill work and very tedious.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>But if you are working on an invention like, say,

and emeralds in an oxy-hydrogen furnace, see
Fig. 61, you will not only study but you will study
harder than you have ever studied before if you believe
it will help you to find the solution of the gem
problem. It is under these conditions that work-study
becomes play-study and you will be fascinated with it
and it will then prove pleasant as well as profitable.</p>

action of the electric current is direct. And they are
inventions of great importance and of recent date.</p>

to produce heat as in the electric furnace. Genuine
diamonds, though too small and too costly to have any
commercial value, have been made in the electric furnace,

MAKING A MODEL</h2>


<p>At the end of the chapter on drawing I explained
how you could make models of mechanical movements
of cardboard. And you will remember that the purpose
of these simple models is to clear up points that
are hazy when you are working out your invention on
paper.</p>

<p class="mt2" id="KINDS_MODELS"><b>Kinds of Models.&mdash;</b>Now besides cardboard models
there are some other kinds, the chief ones being (1)
<i>rough models</i>; (2) <i>scale models</i> and (3) <i>working
models</i>, and each of these kinds is useful in its own
way. The kind you should make, or have made, will
depend on the bulge of your pocketbook as well as on
the nature of your invention as you will presently
see.</p>

<p>There was a time when the United States patent
office required a model of every invention for which
a patent application was made; as a result the noble
patent office finally became a museum filled with antique
models instead of an office in which business
was transacted for and with inventors.</p>

<p>The government officials then concluded that the <i>patent
examiners</i> didn’t really need to see the models any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>way
and then and there they ordered that a patent application
only need be sent to the patent office&mdash;with
one exception; this exception is made when a would-be
inventor applies for a patent on a perpetual motion
machine and then he is asked for a <i>working model</i>
and if this is not forthcoming&mdash;and of course it never
is&mdash;no further attention is paid to him or to his application.</p>

</div>

<p class="mt2" id="ROUGH_MODELS"><b>Rough Models.&mdash;</b>After you have made the drawings
and experiments which your invention calls for
and both have worked out to your satisfaction you
will then have a burning desire to see the result of your
efforts in a more substantial form.</p>

<p>Some machines in which there are only a few moving
parts need not be built up very carefully, or to
exact scale or even of the materials the marketable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
product is to have in it. Very often a model can be
made of wood and scrap metals that will do and show
everything that you want it to. See Fig. 64.</p>

<p>Should you have to employ a patent attorney who
lives at a distance from you, say one who has an office
in Chicago, Philadelphia or Boston, a rough model of
your invention will be of great help to him for it will
give him an insight into its workings and its possibilities
that he is not apt to get from studying your drawings
and description unless you are a good mechanical
draftsman and he is above the average in his profession.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 65.</span> <span class="smcap1">A SCALE MODEL OF AN AEROPLANE</span></div>
</div>

<p class="mt2" id="SCALE_MODELS"><b>Scale Models.&mdash;</b>Scale models are usually miniatures
of the full sized machine, that is every part of the
scale model is reduced in proportion from the dimen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>sions
of the big machine, say 1 inch to the foot or
whatever you want to make it.</p>

<p>Like rough models scale models need not be actual
working models, indeed in many cases it is very hard
if not impossible to make a scale model which will run
or work like a full sized machine, unless the model is
made very large, as for instance model aeroplanes
fitted with motors of any other kind than those made
of rubber strands. Fig. 65 shows a scale model of an
aeroplane.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 66.</span> <span class="smcap1">A TOY HELIOCOPTER</span></div>
</div>

<p>Then again sometimes a scale model will work to
perfection and when a full sized machine is built it
will not work at all as in the case of the <i>heliocopter</i>,
that is, a flying machine having a screw with blades
like a propeller and which when it is rapidly spun by
means of a string like a top will rise in the air to a
height and sail away to a distance of a hundred feet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
or more. Fig. 66 shows a toy <i>heliocopter</i>, or aerial
top as it is called. Many attempts have been made
to build full sized flying machines on the principle
of the toy heliocopter but so far none of them have
been able to get off of the ground.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 67.</span> <span class="smcap1">A WORKING MODEL OF A BRITISH EXPRESS LOCOMOTIVE</span></div>
</div>

<p>Then again there are many machines that can be
made of any size and which will work equally well.
Fig. 67 is a scale model of a British express locomotive.
It is 4 feet long and an exact scale model which
can be fired up with coal and it will make a speed of
10 miles an hour.</p>

<p>A scale model of your invention, if it is a machine,
or an electrical apparatus, when built by an expert
model maker, makes a mighty pretty display and will
never fail to attract attention wherever it may be
shown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p class="mt2" id="WORKING_MODELS"><b>Working Models.&mdash;</b>A working model may be a
scale model as you have seen or it may be a full sized
machine or of any size between these limits.</p>

<p>When you have your invention past the drawing
board and up to the shop bench by all means make a
working model of it and if possible make it full size.
This kind of a model is the proof you want that your
invention will work when it is put to the test and by
making a working model you will find lots of changes
little and big that are needed and which when made
will improve its operation wonderfully.</p>

<p>And however carefully you have worked out your
invention on paper you will find that when you come
to make a model, or have one made, you will have
to change it not once but many times, that is if it is
a machine in which a number of parts are made use
of and you may have to re-design it and re-construct
it several times.</p>

<p>For this reason it is a waste of money to build a
fine appearing and costly model in the beginning but
what you should do is to make one that will work
without regard to its looks so that you can experiment
with it, overhaul it, tear it down, build it up
again and so on until you are satisfied with it and
the results it produces, if such a thing is possible, before
you even begin to talk to a patent attorney about
applying for a patent on it.</p>

<p>Nearly every <i>tyro</i> inventor seems to believe that
the only way to keep honest folks from stealing his
invention is to apply for a patent on it immediately.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
You will remember I pointed out in the first chapter
how to protect your first idea by signatures and <i>affidavits</i>
and protection of this kind is just as good, and
in my opinion just as safe, and in every way better
than to rush off and apply for a patent and&mdash;though
of course money is of no object&mdash;it is cheaper by
at least $35.00.</p>

<p>Again as I stated in the preceding chapter if you
apply for a patent before you have made a working
model of it you will find when you finally get your
model finished it will be so at variance with what you
have written in your specification and claims that you
will hardly be able to recognize it as being the same
invention; and besides there will be the trouble and
the expense of changing your drawings and specification
and claims.</p>

<p>On the other hand when you have finished your
model to the point where it will do the work you
want it to do you are in a position then to make a new
and accurate set of drawings, to write a clear description
of how the machine works and to draw up your
claims with the certainty of knowing just what you
have and what you want to ask for&mdash;in a word you
are ready to do business with the patent office.</p>

<p class="mt2" id="WAYS_TO_MODEL"><b>Ways to Make a Model.&mdash;</b>The way in which you
get your model made depends on several things and
over these you will have little or no control.</p>

<p>There are two ways for you to get a model made
of your invention and these are (1) to make it yourself
and (2) to have a model maker make it for you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>These two general ways may be further divided
into several sub-ways and among these are (a) for
you to have your own workshop, or laboratory and
hire machinists, or electricians, or chemists, and have
them do the work under your direction; (b) for you
to give a model maker the job and have him, or his
men, do it under your supervision and (c) for you to
have separate parts of it made by various model makers
and then assemble them in your own shop.</p>

<p>If you are a little skilled in the use of tools there
isn’t anything I know of that will give you greater
pleasure than to make each part of your model with
your own hands in your own shop and watch it grow
day by day until it becomes in truth the very apple of
your eye. At least that is the way I feel about it.
Moreover it gives you a sense of security you cannot
have when the work is in some one’s else hands.</p>

<p>In making a machine from your own ideas and
plans no one can do the work so well as yourself provided
you can do the work at all and besides it is
cheaper and far more satisfactory.</p>

<p>Should you have a fat pocket-book and at the same
time a taste for inventing and the sciences&mdash;these
elements seldom go hand in mind&mdash;but if they should
get close together in your case I say, the right way
to make a model is to hire skilled men to do the work
while you do the thinking and the assembling in your
private lab. By this process your model will go forward
rapidly and the work will be done in the best
fashion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>Before employing any one to work on your invention
have him sign this agreement:</p>

<p class="center mt2">EMPLOYEE’S PATENT AGREEMENT</p>

<div class="small9">

<p>The undersigned, in consideration of his employment by
Charles Basset, inventor, and in further consideration of the

that all inventions and discoveries pertaining to the business
of the said Charles Basset which may be made by him while
in his employ shall become the property of the said Charles
Basset.</p>

<p>And further, he also agrees to assign to the said Charles
Basset all applications made by him for <i>letters patent</i> of
the United States and elsewhere and all <i>letters patent</i> that
may be granted to him, covering such inventions and discoveries
without further compensation, and</p>

<p>That he will promptly, on conception of any patentable
idea or invention, disclose the same to the said Charles
Basset and on his request so to do will make application for

<p>And further, that he will execute all other papers whatsoever
that may be necessary to transfer to and rest in the
said Charles Basset all the right, title and interest in and

<p class="mt2">The plan of having a model maker do all of the
work under your direction may not appeal very strongly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
to you but after all, if you lack the skill and the
equipment needed for making your model, it is a pretty
good scheme.</p>

<p>Every large model making establishment has separate
rooms fitted up where each inventor can work on
his own machine and this gives you the privacy you
demand and besides whenever you want a part made
or changed you have a skilled mechanic at your beck
and call and a shop equipped with the finest machine
tools for him to use.</p>

<p>Nor need you be afraid that your invention will be
<i>appropriated</i>, which is a high-toned name for theft,
by either the model maker or his employers to whom
you have entrusted your drawings, and for the following
reasons:</p>

<p>(1) Because any hint of such a thing as theft would
ruin his business for all time; (2) because 99 per cent.
of all inventions fail to make money for any one of
99 reasons and (3) because the model maker grows
rich making models for inventors while the latter
mostly go broke; and as far as the employees are concerned
we must grant that they are as honest, or even
more so, than the average run of suffering humanity.</p>

<p>Neither are inventions apt to be stolen by patent
attorneys for the reasons cited above but after you
have worked out your invention, built a model and
obtained a patent you are then in great danger of
being separated from the fruits of your genius and
perseverance by the professional promoter who makes
it his business to finance the invention and at the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
time to feather his own nest; but more about him a
little later.</p>

<p>A good way to safeguard yourself at the hands of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
model makers, if you have any doubts about them, is
to give different model makers different parts to make
and then assemble them yourself. While it takes considerably
longer to build up a model in this secret way
still there is a lot of satisfaction in this method of
procedure.</p>

</div>

<p class="mt2" id="TOOLS_YOU_NEED"><b>The Tools You Need.&mdash;</b>To make a model of any
description you need the usual tools that are the handservants
of every jeweler and machinist, see Fig. 68,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
and you ought to have a small <i>drill press</i>, see Fig. 69,
and a <i>screw cutting lathe</i>, as shown in Fig. 70, if you
can afford these machines.</p>

<p>There are two or three tools that nearly everybody
knows about and yet which very few folks know
enough about to use them. One of these tools is the
<i>vernier</i> and another is the <i>micrometer</i> and both are
used for <i>precision</i> measurements.</p>

<div id="FIG_70" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_b_103.png" width="400" height="291" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 70.</span> <span class="smcap1">A FOOT POWER SCREW-CUTTING LATHE</span></div>
</div>

<p><i>The vernier</i> is not, strictly speaking, a tool in itself
but it is a device that is applied to <i>scales</i> which makes
it possible to measure small fractions of an inch much
more easily and accurately than can be obtained with
the scale alone. The vernier is also used on calipers,
micrometers and other tools and instruments.</p>

<p>The vernier is a short scale which is fitted to and
slides along the edge of a fixed scale as shown in Fig.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
71. The fixed scale is divided into 10ths of an inch
and the vernier, which is ⁹/₁₀ inch long, is divided
into 10 spaces.</p>

<p>Suppose now when you measure a part of your
model that you move the vernier over to the right so
that the first mark of the vernier and the first mark
of the fixed scale are exactly in a line with each other,
then the vernier will have moved just ¹/₁₀ of a scale
division which is ¹/₁₀₀ of an inch.</p>

<div id="FIG_71" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_b_104.png" width="400" height="122" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 71.</span> <span class="smcap1">A VERNIER FOR ACCURATE MEASUREMENT</span></div>
</div>

<p>If the record marks of the vernier and of the fixed
scale are exactly even then the vernier will have moved
²/₁₀ of a scale division or ²/₁₀₀ or ¹/₅₀ of an inch, and
so on. The fraction of the ¹/₁₀ inch that is obtained
with the vernier is added to the number of inches and
the fractions of an inch of the part which is measured.
The vernier gets its name from Pierre Vernier who
invented it in 1631.</p>

<p><i>The micrometer</i> is a tool, or instrument, which will
measure accurately from 0 to 1 inch in thousandths of
an inch. It is one of the most useful measuring devices
that has ever been invented and if you are to
build a model accurately you cannot get along without
one. It is shown in Fig. 72.</p>

<p>There are five parts to a micrometer and these are
(a) the <i>frame</i>; (b) the <i>anvil</i>; (c) the <i>spindle</i>; (d) the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
<i>sleeve</i> and (e) the <i>thimble</i>. The frame is held in the
left hand, the object to be measured being placed between
the anvil and the spindle; the thimble is turned
by the thumb and finger of your right hand and the
spindle, which is fastened to the thimble, turns with it
and moves through the nut in the frame until the
end of the spindle touches the object to be measured.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 72.</span> <span class="smcap1">A MICROMETER FOR MEASURING THOUSANDTHS OF AN INCH</span></div>
</div>

<p>The measurement of the object is shown by the
vertical lines on the spindle and the horizontal lines
on the thimble and both of which are numbered. They
are really a form of vernier.</p>

<p>To <i>read</i> the micrometer, that is to find the measurement
of an object, you have only to multiply the number
of vertical divisions which you can see on the
sleeve by 25 and to this add the number of divisions
on the bevel of the thimble from the 0 line to the
line which coincides with it, that is, comes even with
the long horizontal line on the sleeve. It is easy to
learn to read a micrometer by taking one in your hands,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
making a few measurements and following the above
instructions.</p>

<p>The <i>wire gage</i> is a circular piece of flat steel a little
larger than a silver dollar and it is used to find the
numbers of, and to measure the sizes of, wires. There
are 32 slots cut in the edge each ending in a hole and
numbered from 5 to 36 as shown in Fig. 73.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 73.</span> <span class="smcap1">A STANDARD WIRE GAGE</span></div>
</div>

<p>To find the number of a certain sized wire slip the
latter into the slots until you find one into which it
will just pass snugly and the number of the slot will
be the number of the wire. On the reverse side of the
gage will be found the sizes of the wire in decimal
fractions of an inch.</p>

</div>

<p>There are a number of different wire gages but
the <i>American Standard</i> or <i>Brown</i> and <i>Sharpe</i>, or <i>B<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
and S</i> as it is called for short, is the one mostly used
by machinists in the United States.</p>

<p>Other useful gages are for the measurement of
wood and machine screws; for finding the pitch of
screws; for measuring the inside of tubes, holes, etc.,
and for measuring the outside of rods, tubes, etc.
These tools and all others used by jewelers and machinists
can be bought wherever tools are sold.</p>

<p class="mt2" id="BUYING_MATERIALS"><b>Buying Materials.&mdash;</b>Many inventors waste time
and sacrifice accuracy in making, or trying to make,
wheels, gears, threaded rods, nuts, binding posts, contact
points, switch levers and blades, hard rubber
knobs, handles and other parts.</p>

<p>Now all of these things and hundreds of other parts
can be bought ready made of model makers, gear
works and dealers in hardware, model aeroplanes, electrical
and wireless apparatus. And before you begin
a model of any kind you should get catalogues from
all of the supply houses you see advertised. Fig. 74
shows quite a number of parts you can buy ready
made.</p>

<p class="mt2" id="ABOUT_MAKING"><b>About Making Patterns.&mdash;</b>Very often though you
will have to make a special part out of metal or have
it made. Like everything else there is a <i>best way</i> to
do this.</p>

<p>Suppose you need a <i>standard</i> something like that
used for a telegraph sounder, as shown in Fig. 75. To
saw and file out a solid piece of brass would not only
take a long time but it would prove a very tedious job;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
and this is also true of many other parts you will
need in the course of making your model.</p>

<p>The best way is to make a pattern of wood of the
desired part, take it to a brass, or iron, foundry and
have it cast. It is easy then to smooth it up with a
file or to <i>machine</i> it in a lathe, or shaper, and <i>lacquer</i>
it when it will look like a mechanic’s job.</p>

<div id="FIG_75" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_b_109.png" width="300" height="448" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 75.</span> <span class="smcap1">A STANDARD FOR A TELEGRAPH SOUNDER</span></div>
</div>

<p>It is nice and easy work to make a <i>wood pattern</i>,
that is to cut out of wood the needed part of exactly
the size and shape you want the finished casting to be.
The wood for your pattern should be pine or poplar
and thoroughly seasoned. A scroll saw frame will
come in handy for sawing out small patterns.</p>

<p>Where two pieces of wood are to be fastened together
a good glue should be used. After the pattern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
is built up file out the uneven places with the kind of
files made for scroll-sawyers’ use. When this is done
smooth up the pattern with medium fine sandpaper and
finish it with very fine sandpaper.</p>

<p>Should any holes or cracks show in the pattern after
it has been sandpapered fill them up with <i>putty</i>; and,
last of all, give the pattern a couple of coats of <i>shellac
varnish</i> or rub <i>graphite</i> into it all over to keep it from
sticking to the mold. Your pattern is now ready to
be cast in metal.</p>

<p>A pattern, if it is complicated, should be made by a
skilled pattern maker for it must be made in a certain
way so that it will <i>draw</i> from the mold easily and
without injury to the latter and leave it perfectly
smooth.</p>

<p class="mt2" id="CASTING_IRON"><b>Casting in Iron and Brass.&mdash;</b>Somewhere above I
said that a pattern should be the exact size you want
the finished casting to be but as a matter of precise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
statement iron, brass and nearly all other metals shrink
when they are cooling and so the pattern must be a
trifle larger than the exact size you require and you
must also allow for filing and machining. (See Fig.
76.)</p>

<p>As iron shrinks about ¹/₁₀ of an inch to a foot, brass
shrinks ⅕ of an inch to a foot and steel and aluminum
shrink about ¼ inch to the foot you must allow this
much for shrinkage in making your patterns. Type-metal
is an alloy which expands on cooling and this
is a useful thing to know. You will find a formula for
making it in <i>Appendix L</i>, and all of the <i>appendices</i>
from A to N contain detailed information on a variety
of subjects that should be very helpful when you are
making your model.</p>

<h2 id="CHAP_VI">CHAPTER VI<br />
HOW TO PATENT YOUR INVENTION</h2>


<p>With your model in such shape that it shows what
your invention is and what it will do you are ready
to apply for a <i>patent</i>, or <i>letters patent</i> as it is technically
called, by those versed in the art.</p>

<p class="mt2" id="WHAT_A_PATENT"><b>What a Patent Is.&mdash;</b>The term <i>letters patent</i> comes
from the Latin <i>litteræ patentes</i> which means open or
disclosed, as against the French <i>lettre de cachet</i> which
means closed or secret.</p>

<p>A letters patent, or patent as it is called for short,
is exactly what its name implies and that is a disclosure
of your secret and for this disclosure of a new and
useful invention on your part the government agrees
to give you a <i>monopoly</i>, that is the sole right to make,
use and sell it as you please for a term of 17 years.</p>

<p>But the government does not live up to its agreement
with the inventor and the invention and patent
for it are never securely yours until it has been tested
in the United States Supreme Court and its judges
have handed down their opinion in your favor. But
since there is no better protection than a patent at the
present time of course you will have to get one.</p>

<p class="mt2" id="CHOOSING_ATTORNEY"><b>Choosing a Patent Attorney.&mdash;</b>The next hardest
thing to do after making a working model of your in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>vention
is to get a <i>patent attorney</i> to take out a patent
for you.</p>

<p>I don’t want to infer by this that it is hard to find
a patent attorney for on the contrary they are as numerous
as sharks in the sea and twice as voracious, but a
patent attorney who really understands his business
and will take an interest in your affairs is as scarce
as a <i>pseudotriakis microdon</i>,<span class="fnanchor"><a href="#FN_3" id="FNA_3">[3]</a></span> unless you are backed by
unlimited funds, and then you <i>may</i> get service.</p>

<p>It is a strange thing but just as soon as you begin
to work on an invention you will see in every weekly
paper and magazine you pick up the advertisements of
patent attorneys and usually they are located in Washington
“in a building across the street from the patent
office” or in a building up the street from which the
patent office can be seen.</p>

<p>Their <i>ads</i> are very alluring as they often offer as
an inducement to make a <i>free search</i>, as explained in
Chapter III; to keep your signed <i>evidence of conception</i>
in their fire-proof safes, and to refund your money
if they do not get a patent for you. That these
knights of the patent bar will do all they say there is
not the slightest doubt and that is just where the
rub comes in.</p>

<p>Any patent attorney can get a patent allowed on
nearly anything if the claims are written <i>narrow</i>
enough but when it is granted it won’t be worth the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
paper it is written on and the patent examiner knows
it, the patent attorney who gets it knows it and you
will know it too after you have spent your good money
for it but then it is too late. A patent attorney of
this kind is a good one to keep away from.</p>

<p>The safest way is to go to a patent attorney in
your own city or get into communication with one
who lives nearest to you and engage him to prepare
your patent application and <i>prosecute</i> it in the patent
office.</p>

<p>And whatever you do make him agree to a <i>flat-rate</i>,
that is to name a fixed sum which you are to pay him
for his services including the fee for filing the application
in the patent office. The <i>filing fee</i> is $15 and
the lowest fee I ever heard of any patent attorney taking
to prepare a case and seeing it through the patent
office was $30, which with the final government fee of
$20 makes a total of $65; and from this his fee will go
on up to whatever amount he thinks he will be able to
get you to pay.</p>

<p>Should you happen to secure the services of a so-called
really high-grade patent attorney you will not be
likely to induce him to make a flat-rate for this is poor
business on his part. Instead the way a better class
patent attorney will deal with you, as a rule, is to induce
you to start in by giving him a <i>retainer</i> of say
$25 or $50; then from time to time he will send you
statements and as you pay them the amounts he demands
will grow larger and the statements more frequent
until by the time the patent is granted, you will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
have paid in enough to buy him a fur-trimmed overcoat
or a Ford automobile.</p>

<p>The amount thus spent is not of so much consequence
but what does matter is that where you and your
patent attorney have no definite arrangement as to
fees he is tempted, and in many cases yields to the
temptation, to string the patent application along over
a period of months if not of years, when if it had been
followed up right along it would have been granted to
you in a much shorter time.</p>

<p>The moral of this un-fable is to hold your patent
attorney down to a fixed price right in the beginning
and have him write you a letter stating the amount
he is to get and the work he intends to do for it, and
this will serve as an agreement.</p>

<p>The above are only a few of the bubbles in the
patent system and to warn you of them all would take
a book as large as an unabridged dictionary. The
best advice I can give you is to study your invention
from every angle, look up the state of the art in all
its phases and then with a full understanding of just
what you are entitled to write down all the points you
want your patent to cover.</p>

<p>Now catch your patent attorney, being sure he does
not catch you first, and to <i>parodize</i> a <i>caption</i><span class="fnanchor"><a href="#FN_4" id="FNA_4">[4]</a></span> of the
immortal Roosevelt, <i>fear the patent office examiner
and take your medicine</i>.</p>

<p class="mt2" id="APPLYING_PATENT"><b>Applying for a Patent Yourself.&mdash;</b>To get even a
small part of what you are <i>legally</i> entitled to in a patent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
you should write to the <i>Commissioner of Patents</i>,
Washington, D. C., for a copy of the <i>Rules of Practice
in the United States Patent Office</i>, see Fig. 77, which
will be sent to you free of charge. Read this booklet
through not once, but many times, or at least until you
understand everything in it for it will help you mightily
in the preparation of your <i>patent application</i> and
the prosecution of it.</p>

<div id="FIG_77" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_b_116.png" width="300" height="487" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 77. Rules of practice of the patent office</span></div>
</div>

<p>You will learn from the <i>Rules of Practice</i> that you
as an inventor may apply for your own patent and
act as your own patent attorney in prosecuting it.
And after you have learned the <i>rules</i> by heart you
may feel that since you know more about your invention
than any one else you can make the drawings and
write the specification and claims as well or better
than the average patent attorney.</p>

<p>But you should think twice and count ten with your
eyes shut before you conclude to do this rash thing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
Why? Because the patent office will not accept your
<i>drawings</i> unless they conform exactly to certain rules;
your <i>specification</i>, which means the description of your
invention, must be written in a certain way, and the
<i>claims</i>, which are the very vitals of the whole patent,
must be drawn with exceeding care for while nothing
of value must be left out it is even worse to write in
too much as this limits your claims.</p>

<p>Besides these reasons it grieves a patent office examiner
whenever a mere inventor comes forth and files
his own patent application and conducts his own case
even if he has the ability to do so and when it comes to
<i>amending</i> his claims he will find the hurdles are rather
higher to jump over than he at first supposed.</p>

<p class="mt2" id="APPLYING_PATENT_ATT"><b>Applying for a Patent through a Patent Attorney.&mdash;</b>Taking
all these things into consideration my
advice to you is to retain a patent attorney to prepare
your case and see it through the patent office, and
then you want to be prepared to watch every move he
makes&mdash;that is to say when he has drafted your application,
get a copy of it and go all over it yourself
taking plenty of time to do it in; and then go over
it with him covering every detail.</p>

<p>In due time after your application has been filed the
patent examiner will send a <i>letter</i> to your patent attorney
in which he notifies you that some, if not all of
your claims, have been <i>rejected</i> and <i>citing references</i>
to other patents chiefly to show that your claims lack
newness and novelty.</p>

<p>The next step is taken by your patent attorney who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
<i>amends</i> the specification and claims to meet the objections
raised by the patent examiner. Here again
you should know how and where your claims are affected
and you should aid your patent attorney to determine
whether or not you should insist on your
claim being allowed to stand as it is written or to so
change it that it will satisfy the patent examiner.</p>

<p>It must be clear now that if your patent attorney is
permitted to keep on changing your claims to meet
every rejection of the patent examiner instead of
fighting them out by the time the patent is granted it
will have degenerated into merely a scrap of paper.
Hence if you leave the whole case to the ability and
judgment of your patent attorney you can be reasonably
sure that your $65 or $250 or whatever sum you
have paid him for obtaining your patent is as good as
thrown away.</p>

<p class="mt2" id="WHAT_YOU_MAY"><b>What You May Patent.&mdash;</b>In all of the foregoing
text I assumed that your invention consisted of a machine
but according to rule 24 of the <i>Rules of Practice</i>
a patent may be obtained for <i>any new and useful art,
machine, manufacture or composition of matter, or
any new or useful improvement thereof</i>.</p>

<p>Since all mechanical movements have been invented
and all necessary electric currents have been discovered
and enough chemical elements are known it may seem
on first thought quite impossible to invent or discover
anything either new or useful, yet the patent office is
granting patents at the rate of about 125,000 a year.</p>

<p>The way inventions are made is by forming new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
<i>combinations</i>. Just as there is no practical limit to the
number of new words that could be formed by new
combinations of the letters of the alphabet, so there
is no practical limit to the new machines that can be
invented by novel combinations of the mechanical
movements, with the result that something can be done
that had not been done before, or that something
is done in a better, cheaper and easier way than it had
ever been done before. And the same is also true of
combining electro-mechanical devices and of combining
chemical elements.</p>

<p>Inventing means that you are clever in combining
certain movements, devices and chemicals in a new
way to produce a certain result which may or may
not have been done before, and so it is the new <i>combination</i>
of things that you really get a patent on.</p>

<p class="mt2" id="LOOKING_AHEAD"><b>Looking Ahead.&mdash;</b>It must be plain now from what
has been said that when you have completed your machine,
or product, or compound, all your inventive
efforts will be in vain unless you go over every part
with the utmost care and try to think out how it could
be changed or done in some other way by some one else
and so make your patent worthless, and your hard efforts
wasted.</p>

<p>What you should do, though it is easier to advise
than it is to accomplish, is to so word the claims of your
patent application that they will broadly cover not only
your particular combination but every other form of it.
Finally should your invention be one of considerable
magnitude and great importance you must keep working<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
on it all the time and making improvements and
covering the last named with patents or the other fellow&mdash;the
patent thief&mdash;will get you sure, and often he
will do it anyway.</p>

<p class="mt2" id="WHAT_PATENT_CONSISTS"><b>What a Patent Consists Of.&mdash;</b>All through this
chapter the words <i>drawings</i>, <i>specifications</i> and <i>claims</i>
are used and now suppose we find out just what is
meant by them.</p>

<p>Every patent application is made up of five parts
and these are (1) the <i>petition</i>; (2) the <i>drawings</i>; (3)
the <i>specification</i>; (4) the <i>claims</i>, and (5) the <i>oath</i>.
The petition and the oath are separate papers and do
not appear in the patent when it is granted. The
drawings, specification and claims form the patent
when it is granted.</p>

<p><i>The form of petition</i> by a sole inventor is as follows:</p>

<div class="small9 mt2">

<p class="uni"><i>To the Commissioner of Patents:</i></p>

<p>Your petitioner, ..............., a citizen of the United
States and a resident of ......, in the county of ...... and
State of ...... (or subject, etc.), whose post-office address
is ........, prays that letters patent may be granted to him
for the improvement in ............, set forth in the annexed
specification.</p>

<p>Signed at ........., in the county of ....... and State
of ......, this .... day of ......, 19..</p>

</div>

<p class="mt2">Other forms by joint inventors, etc., will be found in
the <i>Rules of Practice</i>.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 78.</span> <span class="smcap1">A PAGE OF DRAWINGS FOR A WIRELESS TELEPHONE ARC</span></div>
</div>

<p><i>The drawing</i> or drawings come first and these are
made on white paper the thickness of Bristol board and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
the size of the sheet must be exactly 10 by 15 inches
with a line drawn 1 inch from the edges all round making
the <i>sight</i>, that is, the space in which the drawings
are placed, exactly 8 by 13 inches. A reduction of a
sheet of drawing for the author’s <i>revolving arc</i> for
his wireless telephone is shown in Fig. 78.</p>

<p>The drawing or drawings, there may be one or more
on a page and several pages if needs be, must show
every detail covered by the specification and claims.
The drawings may be made in <i>isometric perspective</i>
as described in Chapter II, or plan or elevation views
can be used, or both of these kinds of drawings as long
as the pictures show exactly what the invention consists
of and how it works. Usually the different parts
are numbered and these are referred to in the description
of the invention.</p>

<p>Should your invention be an electrical one, then a
diagram of the apparatus formed of symbols (see
<a href="#CHAP_II">Chapter II</a>) should be used.</p>

<p>The <i>specification</i>, the front page of one of which is
shown in Fig. 79, is that part of a patent which describes
your invention or discovery and it should be
as full and as clear as you and your patent attorney can
make it and yet it must be concise and to the point.</p>

<p>Don’t try to hide, or keep anything back for should
the patent be granted to you under these conditions it
will be without value if it should ever figure in a suit.
If you are not willing to make every detail known it is
better not to apply for a patent at all.</p>

the all important part of every patent and these must
be clearly, cleverly and carefully worded so that if you
ever have to fight an infringer in court your claims will
be found to cover exactly the details of your invention
and this will make it harder for the other fellow’s expert
to misconstrue them.</p>

<p><i>The oath.</i> When you apply for a patent you must
affirm, or make oath that you believe yourself to be the
“first and original inventor or discoverer of the art,
machine, manufacture, composition or improvement”
for which you ask a patent. A form of oath to accompany
a patent application is as follows:</p>

<div class="small9 mt2">
<p class="uni">

</p>

<p>........ ........, the above-named petitioner..., being

...... inventor ... of the improvement in .......... described

or used before ..... invention or discovery thereof, or patented
or described in any printed publication in any country
before ...... invention or discovery thereof, or more than
two years prior to this application, or in public use or on
sale in the United States for more than two years prior to
this application; that said invention has not been patented in
any country foreign to the United States on an application
filed by ........ or ...... legal representatives or assigns
more than twelve months prior to this application; and that

<p class="mt2">A good way to get an idea of how a patent looks and
reads is to send 5 cents in coin to the Commissioner of
Patents, Washington, D. C., with the request that a
copy of patent No. 814,942 be mailed to you.</p>

<p class="mt2" id="PATENT_PENDING"><b>While Your Patent is Pending.&mdash;</b>In a month or
six weeks after your application has been sent in to the
patent office your patent attorney will receive an official
reply, or <i>action</i> as it is called, and don’t be surprised
and don’t let it worry you if you find that all
your claims have been rejected by the examiner.</p>

<p>He will state his reasons in his letter for the rejection
and give references, which are usually other patents,
to show that some other inventor has <i>anticipated</i>
you and that your claims are neither new nor novel.</p>

<p>Your patent attorney must then either <i>amend</i> the
claims, that is reword and change them if you and he
think the examiner is right, or else in your letter of
amendment, you must show the examiner where and
why he is wrong. At any rate you must satisfy his
objections.</p>

<p>By the time your amended application reaches the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
examiner and he again acts on it he will have dug up a
lot more of references from the <i>archives</i> of the patent
office; and then you and your patent attorney can go all
over the amending process again.</p>

<p>After having gone through with this sort of thing a
dozen or more times and covering one or more years&mdash;I
have just had a patent allowed that had been pending
for nearly seven years&mdash;you and your patent attorney
and every one else that may be interested with
you will be sore unto death over the delays&mdash;that is
everybody except the patent examiner and he thrives
upon the inventor’s discontent.</p>

<p class="mt2" id="INTERFERENCE"><b>Interference.&mdash;</b>As if all these trials and tribulations
are not enough it often occurs in the course of a pending
patent that some one applies for a patent on the
same, or nearly the same, invention as your own.</p>

<p>When this happens the patent examiner declares an
<i>interference</i>, the purpose of which purports to be to
show which applicant is the first, or real inventor.</p>

<p>When interference proceedings are begun you will
have to make under oath a <i>preliminary statement</i> showing
when you first conceived the idea of your invention,
when you first explained it to some one else, when you
made your first drawings of it and when you constructed
a model of it; all of which shows the importance
of keeping a record of each step of your invention
and of having them frequently attested.</p>

<p>These sworn statements by yourself and your opponent
are passed upon by the <i>examiner of interferences</i>
and if either you or your opponent are not satisfied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
with his findings either one of you may take an
appeal to the <i>board of examiners-in-chief</i>, and from
this board to the <i>Commissioner of Patents</i> and finally,
to the <i>Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia</i>.</p>

<p>And don’t forget that all these proceedings and appeals
are as meat and drink to the patent lawyers and
that you and your opponent are contributing <i>all</i> of the
money in exchange for a lot of red tape that ought to
be abolished.</p>

<p class="mt2" id="WHEN_YOUR_PATENT"><b>When Your Patent is Granted.&mdash;</b>But some bright
morning you will receive a government document
printed on vellum, showing a picture of the patent office
at the top and signed by the Commissioner of Patents
at the bottom, the whole being tied together with a
pair of baby blue ribbons and to the ends of which is
affixed a red seal bearing the imprint of the <i>Patent
Office of the United States of America</i>, and at last you
have your patent. The front cover of a patent granted
to your humble servant is shown in the frontispiece.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b>After Your Patent is Granted.&mdash;</b>But after you
have this valuable grant conferred by the government
in your possession which is alleged to give you a
monopoly on your invention for a period of 17 years
you have only started on your career as <i>patentee</i>, for
about the next thing that will happen, if your invention
is worth anything and you are manufacturing and
marketing it, you will find that some one else is making
and selling exactly the same thing.</p>

<p>He may or may not have a patent on the article or
machine and it&mdash;the patent&mdash;may or may not be remotely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
like yours but this doesn’t in the least matter, he
will keep right on working your invention and <i>infringing</i>
your patent until you will either have to sue
him, or continue to lose large profits that should be
yours and perhaps be driven out of the business entirely.</p>

<p>So, of course, you see your patent attorney and he,
of course, advises you to begin suit at once. It sounds
to your abused ears like right and justice but it means
an outlay of much time and more money than you
could begin to think of unless you have been through
the mill before.</p>

<p>This time you will have to engage <i>patent counsel</i>&mdash;no
mere patent attorney will do if you are to win&mdash;and
you must have <i>experts</i> to testify for you and
your <i>patent cause</i>&mdash;it is no longer called a patent case&mdash;and
testify against your opponent. The only limit
to the fee that able patent counsel will demand and collect
is fixed by your bank account while $100 per day
is the usual fee of a <i>technical expert</i> though like his
legal ally he will ask and get much more if you can afford
it.</p>

<p>After long months of drawn out preparation and
taking testimony and quibbling you will find, if your
legal talent is the smartest, that the patent granted
you by the patent office has been sustained by the court.
Such a decision may put the other fellow out of the
business but it isn’t once in a thousand causes you can
collect damages when you win. And from this you
will observe that the business of the patent office is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
to give you a monopoly but simply to grant you a patent
and as to its validity the courts must settle that.</p>

<p class="mt2" id="ABOUT_PAPER"><b>About Paper Patents.&mdash;</b>A <i>paper patent</i> is a patent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
that has been granted by the patent office for a new and
novel idea that has never been worked out in practice.</p>

<p>For instance, suppose you get an idea for an invention
or an improvement that seems a good thing
especially after you have looked up the state of the art,
and when you draw it out on paper it seems certain to
work. And let’s suppose that for the want of time or
money you are not able to experiment on, or build a
model of it; and you have fears that by the time you
could build the actual machine some one else may have
applied for a patent on the same thing.</p>

<p>Of course, you feel you want to protect the idea and
to do so you proceed to apply for a patent and in its
own good time the patent office grants you one. You
have then a thing called a <i>paper patent</i> but you haven’t
got the machine, or device or composition to back it up
with.</p>

<p>Well, it’s just like writing a book about a trip to the
moon; you know how far from the facts your guesses
would probably be and it is the same thing with getting
a patent before you have made the experiments or built
a model.</p>

<p>A paper patent is not usually worth the time and
money you spend on it because it lacks backbone, but
they have caused many real inventors a deal of trouble
and expense in fighting them.</p>

<h2 id="CHAP_VII">CHAPTER VII<br />
MAKING YOUR INVENTION PAY</h2>


<p>After reading what has gone before you may well
conclude that an inventor’s life is not a happy one but
let me remind you that whatever road you take to seek
fame and to win fortune you will find it just as full of
petty strife and big difficulties.</p>

<p>In sooth inventing is one of the easiest and pleasantest
pursuits in which you can engage to make a good
living and many inventors who were as poor as Job’s
turkey when they began to think up new ideas and concoct
useful schemes now have their thumb-nail biographies
in <i>Who’s Who</i> and live on the fat of the land.</p>

<p>And you can do the same thing too if you have a
real invention and a lot of native shrewdness. Yes, to
be a money-making inventor you must have inventive
ability plus business ability, or rather the other way
about, for business ability counts for more in the game
of success than inventive ability.</p>

<p>There are hundreds of inventors of the highest type
who are comparatively poor men for the lack of business
ability while many others, like Edison, all round
inventor, Westinghouse, inventor of the air brake,
and Eastman, inventor of the kodak, have made
fortunes that run up into the millions because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
they are first, last and all the time hard headed business
men. And you must be a business man too if you want
to make money out of your invention.</p>

<p class="mt2" id="HOW_TO_RAISE"><b>How to Raise the Initial Funds.&mdash;</b>By <i>initial funds</i>
I mean the first money. It is easy to tell an inventor
who has a rich dad or a bank account in his own name
how to finance his invention.</p>

<p>But mine is a harder task in that I am taking it for
granted you are like 999 out of every 1000 inventors
and that you have little or no money, are fired with
ambition and that you have a big idea.</p>

<p>Assuming that this is the precise state of affairs let’s
go back to where we started from in Chapter I, that is
to the last part of it where you had drawn out your
invention on paper, written a description of it and had
some of your friends put their signatures to it.</p>

<p>Should your invention seem to your friends to have
merit it will take but very little urging to get one or
more of them to furnish whatever amount of money
you think will be needed to carry on the experiments or
to build a working model. Of course you will in turn
have to agree to give him, or them, a certain small interest
in your invention, and this is fair exchange for
you are putting up your brains against their money.</p>

<p>If your invention is a small one and but little money
is needed to develop it into a <i>marketable</i> product a 5
per cent. interest is enough to give those who back you
for taking the risk. A 10 per cent. interest is ample
to offer for sufficient funds to develop a more complicated
invention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>This will leave you a 30 or 35 per cent. interest to
sell to others later on, when you have a working model
and your patent is granted, to furnish the capital necessary
for equipping a factory to make the device and to
provide funds to market it&mdash;that is if you work out
a plan along these lines.</p>

<p>But take my advice and keep a 55 per cent. interest
in the invention for yourself; otherwise the control of
it is taken out of your hands, and whenever it suits
those who hold the controlling interest to freeze you
out they will do so with pleasure.</p>

<p>By using the following form you can save the expense
of having a lawyer draw up one for you and
moreover you can also be sure there is no <i>joker</i> in it.</p>

<p class="center">FORM OF AN INTEREST AGREEMENT</p>

<p><i>Memorandum of Agreement</i> made this <i>third</i> day of <i>September,
1916</i>, between <span class="smcap">William Franklin</span>, of Peoria, Illinois
(inventor), and <span class="smcap">George Wilson</span>, of Peoria, Illinois,
WITNESSETH: That</p>

<p>WHEREAS, the said <i>William Franklin</i> has invented what
he verily believes to be a new and useful improvement in
<i>gas engines</i> and for which he will apply for letters patent of
the United States, provided certain tests which he shall make
shall work out satisfactorily, and</p>

<p>WHEREAS, the said <i>George Wilson</i> is desirous of obtaining
an interest in the net profits arising from the sale
or working of the said invention after the said letters patent
of the United States has been granted:</p>

<p>NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises
and of One Dollar to each in hand paid by the other, the
receipt whereof is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereunto
do covenant and agree as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>FIRST: That the said <i>William Franklin</i> for and in consideration
of the payment of $1000 by the said <i>George Wilson</i>
will pay to the said <i>George Wilson</i> 5 per cent. of all net
receipts accruing in any manner from the sale or working of
the said invention and patent during the term of its life.</p>

<p>SECOND: That the said <i>George Wilson</i> shall pay to the
said <i>William Franklin</i> the sum of $1000 which shall be applied
to the making of a <i>model</i> of the said invention and to
securing a letters patent of the United States for the same.</p>

<p>It is understood and agreed that this instrument shall bind
the parties hereto, their heirs, executors, administrators, successor
or successors or assigns.</p>

<p>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have hereunto
interchangedly set their hands and seals the day and
year first above written.</p>

</div>

<p class="mt2" id="ABOUT_AN_INTEREST"><b>About an Interest in a Patent.&mdash;</b>There is a big
difference between assigning an interest in your invention
and assigning an interest in your patent.</p>

<p>Many an inventor assigns an interest in his patent
either before or after it is granted to some one who
will advance the needed money. But this is a thing
you should never do for after having made such an
<i>assignment</i>, however small the part, the person who
owns it can make, use or sell the invention which the
patent covers, as he chooses, just as though he owned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
the whole patent and you can neither stop him nor even
sue him for damages.</p>

<p>You can, of course, make, use and sell the invention
covered by the patent too but usually it is the other
fellow who gets the best of the bargain.</p>

<p class="mt2" id="ROYALTIES"><b>Royalties, Shop Rights, etc.&mdash;</b>After you have
built a working model and obtained a patent on it there
are many ways of making money out of your invention.</p>

<p>One is to sell your invention and patent outright; another
is to sell <i>shop-right licenses</i>; another is to have
some manufacturer give you a <i>royalty</i> on each machine
or device he makes and sells, and yet another way is to
sell <i>territorial rights</i>, that is the town, county and state
rights to manufacture your invention. Forms of
agreements for all of these deals will be found in the
<i>Rules of Practice</i> of the United States Patent Office.</p>

<p>Besides the above arrangements you can go into
partnership with some moneyed man, or interest, and
finally a good plan, where a large amount of capital is
required to build a plant and start a business, is to form
a company, or <i>corporation</i> as it is called.</p>

<p class="mt2" id="FORMING_PARTNERSHIP"><b>Forming a Partnership.&mdash;</b>Now that you have your
model completed and your patent granted you will of
course want to begin <i>commercial operations</i> immediately,
and let’s suppose you think better of forming a
partnership than any of the other above named plans.</p>

<p>There are a hundred ways to secure a partner, or
<i>business associate</i> as the sharer of your fortunes is
called, but it is a mighty hard thing to get a satisfactory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
one. A favorite way to enlist capital and one that
is often resorted to by inventors in large cities is to
advertise in the newspapers under the head of <i>business
opportunities</i>.</p>

<p>An advertisement of this kind may put you in touch
with the man you are looking for but it will also bring
you a lot of curiosity seekers, riff raff and other undesirables
who come generally with a view of inducing
you to part with your money rather than to invest any
of their own. This is also true of the so-called <i>brokers</i>
who advertise to procure working capital for meritorious
inventions.</p>

<p>One of the best ways to secure a partner who has the
necessary capital and requisite business ability is to arrange
to show your invention in operation and then
invite your moneyed neighbors and the business men of
your town, though you may not know the latter personally,
to call and see it; and they will call and get interested
if they believe in its possibilities for they are as
anxious to make more money as you are to make a
little of it, and they are keen to the fact that great
fortunes have been built up out of simple as well as
complex inventions.</p>

<p>This method of showing your invention to your
towns-folk, either individually or collectively, is the
safe way to get one or more good, substantial men interested
in your proposition and to lay the foundation
of a paying business.</p>

<p class="mt2" id="PROMOTER"><b>Where the Promoter Comes In.&mdash;</b>There are promoters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
and promoters; by which I mean that there are
various sorts of promoters and then some.</p>

<p>A <i>tin-horn promoter</i> is an unprincipled fellow of
some ability who secures an <i>option</i> on a patented invention,
or on the stock of a company based on an invention,
and exploits it for all he is worth to his own
profit and without regard to the inventor or the stockholders.
The chief business of a tin-horn promoter
is to secure control of the entire stock issue of a company,
sell it at inflated prices, pocket 90 per cent. of
the proceeds and either doctor the books or disappear
then altogether. Steer clear of the tin-horn promoter.</p>

<p>An <i>ordinary promoter</i> is merely an agent who acts
as a go-between for the inventor and people with money
to invest and by his enthusiasm brings them together
for the good of the cause. A <i>real promoter</i> is a genius
who possesses both business ability and the necessary
wherewithal to start, <i>accelerate</i> and carry on any
kind of an <i>industrial</i>, <i>financial</i> or <i>commercial</i> enterprise.</p>

<p>You will meet the promoter in one shape or another
as soon as it becomes noised around that you have an
invention of merit. The ordinary promoter will be of
assistance to you at any stage of the invention where
experiments are still to be made and the patent is yet to
be granted. He may also prove of service after the
<i>preliminary</i> work is done in securing for you a real promoter.</p>

<p>On signing contracts with the latter he will relieve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
you of all the cares of starting the business or of starting
a company to start the business. And if you are
not shrewd and careful and know just what he is doing
and you should fail to have a hard and fast contract
he will not only be likely to relieve you of the business
cares but of everything else you may hold dear and
sacred in this world.</p>

<p>An ordinary promoter will ask about 25 per cent.
of whatever money he brings in for your use in developing
the invention and a certain small interest&mdash;1
to 5 per cent.&mdash;in the company that exploits it. The
real promoter wants and usually gets a working agreement
of 50 per cent, of whatever profits there may be
made out of the invention. If possible you should
hold a 55 per cent, interest for this will give you the
whip-hand and will save you much trouble in the end.</p>

<p>Few promoters though will agree to such a division
and about the only way you can keep the controlling
interest is to organize a company and manage it yourself
but this takes business ability of quite a high order.</p>

<p class="mt2" id="STOCK_COMPANY"><b>What a Stock Company Is.&mdash;</b>A <i>company</i> is a
number of persons who band themselves together for
business purposes. A <i>stock company</i>, or <i>stock corporation</i>
to call it by its proper name, is a company
whose <i>capital</i> is represented by <i>shares</i> and which is
held either in the <i>treasury</i> of the company, or by persons
who buy the shares.</p>

<p>Three or more persons may form themselves into a
stock company for any industrial purpose in the State
of New York. A stock company must be <i>incorporated</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
that is <i>legally formed</i>, under the laws of a State
and different States have different laws. A copy of
the corporation laws of any State may be had free of
charge by applying to the Secretary of State.</p>

<p class="mt2" id="HOW_STOCK_COMPANY"><b>How a Stock Company is Organized.&mdash;</b>Suppose,
now, you and two other, or more persons want to organize
a stock company under the laws of the State of
New York for say $10,000, although the value which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
you, and those interested with you, place on your invention
and patent may be a great deal more.</p>

<p>Then you and the others make, sign, acknowledge
and file a <i>certificate of incorporation</i>, a reproduction of
which is shown in Fig. 83 (see outfit necessary for a
Corporation), and this must contain: (1) the name of
the proposed company; (2) the purpose for which it is
formed; (3) the amount of the <i>Capital stock</i> (which
means the entire amount of the stock, for which the
company is capitalized and which, let’s say, is $10,000);
(4) the number of <i>shares</i> of which the capital stock is
to consist (each share of which must not be less than
$5 nor more than $100 and the amount of actual capital
must not be less than $500 in cash with which the
company is to begin business) and the amount of cash
must be stated; (5) The certificate must also contain
the name of the city, village, or town, in which its principal
business office is to be located; (6) its duration,
which you can put at 50 years; (7) the number of its
directors which must be not less than three; (8) the
names and post-office addresses of the directors for the
first year, and (9) the names and post-office addresses
of the subscribers to the certificate of incorporation and
a statement of the number of shares of stock which each
agrees to take in the company. A <i>certificate of incorporation
blank</i> ready to fill in can be bought for 10
cents of stationers who deal in law books and forms.</p>

<p class="mt2" id="FEES_STATE"><b>The Fees of the State.&mdash;</b>The fees for incorporating
a company are payable in advance at the Secretary
of State’s office and these are for (a) filing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
certificate of incorporation $10; (b) recording it, 15
cents per folio of 100 words; (c) a <i>certified copy</i>, if
you want one, 15 cents a folio and $1 additional for
the seal affixed to it; (d) the <i>organization</i> tax, payable
<i>direct</i> to the State Treasurer <i>in advance</i> is 1-20th of
1 per cent, on the amount of the capital stock, which on
a capitalization of $10,000 would be $5, and (e) all
personal checks for fees or taxes must be <i>certified</i>, that
is to have the paying teller of the bank your check is
drawn on write <i>good</i> on it together with his name.</p>

<p class="mt2" id="OUTFIT"><b>Outfit Needed by a Corporation.&mdash;</b>To begin business
with after you have received your certificate of
incorporation you must have:</p>

<p>(1) A <i>minute book</i> in which to record the proceedings
of the directors’ and stockholders’ meetings. A
minute book with <i>printed forms</i> can be obtained which
makes it easy to record the minutes accurately.</p>

<p>(2) A <i>stock certificate book</i>; suppose your certificates,
or shares, have a <i>par value</i> of $100 then you will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
need a book of 100 certificates to equal $10,000. A
stock certificate is reproduced in Fig. 84.</p>

<p>(3) A <i>book of account</i> is required by the New
York State <i>transfer tax</i> law where companies are doing
business in the State, and <i>transfer agents</i> must also
have one to show every transfer of stock. Neglect to
keep this book imposes a heavy penalty.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 85.</span> <span class="smcap1">A SEAL PRESS</span></div>
</div>

<p>(4) The New York <i>transfer law</i> also requires New
York companies to keep a <i>stock transfer book</i> which
shows when shares, or certificates, are sold, or transferred,
by one person to another.</p>

<p>(5) A stock ledger is also needed by every corporation
to enter the stock transactions of each day in. A
combination book with all of the three last named can
be bought ready for use.</p>

<p>(6) A <i>corporate seal</i>, which is an embossed impression
of the name of the company, see Fig. 84, is made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
by a <i>seal press</i> as shown in Fig. 85, and this is also required
by law. The whole outfit above described for
incorporating and maintaining a company can be bought
for the small sum of $10 or less of the Brown-Green
Company, 48 John Street, New York City.</p>

<p class="mt2" id="STOCK_COMPANY_OPERATED"><b>How a Stock Company is Operated.&mdash;</b>When you
receive your certificate of incorporation you can then
call a meeting of the <i>directors</i> (named in the certificate
of incorporation) or <i>board of directors</i> as they are
called. At this first meeting the directors elect the
<i>officers</i>, that is a president, a secretary and a treasurer.</p>

<p>The president then takes the chair and the secretary
writes down all the minutes of the business transacted
at this and subsequent meetings. The first business
that will come before the directors after the election
of the officers is to make the stock of the company <i>full
paid</i>. To do this you must turn your invention and
patent over to the company in exchange for the full
amount of the stock the company is capitalized for, say
$10,000. In other words you sell your right, title and
interest in the invention and patent for $10,000 worth
of stock, which is all of it.</p>

<p>Next you turn back into the treasury of the company
45 per cent, of the stock and keep 55 per cent. for
yourself. The 45 per cent. of the stock in the treasury,
which is called <i>treasury stock</i>, can then be sold at its
<i>par value</i>, that is full value, which is $100 per share
or at any smaller price the board of directors may agree
upon. The sale of the treasury stock gives the company
the capital it needs to start the business and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
to keep it moving until it becomes self-supporting.</p>

<p>If $4,500 is not enough money to finance your company
then capitalize it for whatever amount you think
will be needed and add about 50 per cent. more to it.
You can incorporate a company for $100,000 just as
easy as you can for $10,000, but this is a matter you
and your friends should consider most carefully.</p>

<p>Should you at any time sell more than 5 per cent. of
your holdings, that is of the stock you own, the control
of the company will pass out of your hands and the
other directors and stockholders will whip-saw you as
they like, if they can pull together, for the majority
of the stock will be in their hands.</p>

<p>The stock, or <i>securities</i>, as it is called, of a company
can be sold in a number of ways but the usual method
is to sell it (a) by personal solicitation, (b) through
stock-salesmen, (c) have a broker take the whole stock
issue, and (d) by advertising. If your invention is
what it seems to be, your patent as good as the average
patent, your company capitalized for a moderate
amount and the product looks good for making quick
sales and large profits you won’t find any trouble in
placing the stock with the moneyed people of your community.</p>

<p>Besides receiving 55 per cent. of the stock for your
invention and patent you should as the inventor and
practical man be voted a salary of $25, $50 or $100 per
week to superintend the manufacturing end of the business.
Have a salary contract drawn up with the company
in which the amount you are to receive weekly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
and the length of time you are to receive it is stated,
and have it signed by the president and secretary for
the company.</p>

<p class="mt2" id="RETAINING_LAWYER"><b>About Retaining a Lawyer.&mdash;</b>In all of your business
dealings with other people from the very beginning
the safest way is to have the advice and help of a <i>corporation</i>
lawyer and while he is keeping you safe,
whole and harmless from all damage be sure he doesn’t
mulct you while he is doing it.</p>

<p>A good way is to pay him a flat-rate for whatever advice
he gives you and the contracts he draws up for
you. But if you can’t do this then give him a 1 per
cent interest in the net amount which you may receive
from your invention.</p>

<p>When you and your associates have decided on
organizing a company the usual and proper way is to retain
a lawyer and have him take care of the incorporation
certificate, conduct the first meeting and open
the books, to the end that it may all be done right and in
good legal form.</p>

<h2 id="CHAP_VIII">CHAPTER VIII<br />
SOME HINTS ON MANUFACTURING</h2>


<p>After you have formed a partnership or a company
and have the coveted capital to go ahead with the
business, you and your associates must consider two
problems and the way you work them out will decide
whether your venture will lose money or <i>declare dividends</i>.</p>

<p class="mt2" id="PROBLEM_MANUFACTURE"><b>The Problem of Manufacture.&mdash;</b>These two problems
are the manufacturing and the marketing of your
product and in this chapter we will talk about manufacturing
it first and then take up the marketing end of
it in the next chapter, for while they are closely allied
in a common cause they have to be treated as entirely
separate things.</p>

<p>In this respect a manufacturing concern is very like
a human being in that it has a brain and a body. You
and those interested with you are the brains of the
organization and those who work for you, to the end
that profits may pile up for your benefit and behoof,
form the body.</p>

<p>On your head, most likely, will fall the responsibility
of turning out a high-grade product at the lowest
possible cost and to do this the right way and to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
best advantage you must begin at the beginning and
think and scheme out how you can obtain the best
results with the least outlay of time, labor and money.</p>

<p>There are many ways to start in manufacturing your
product but the <i>efficient</i> way will depend on what you
have to make, the number you are to make and the
amount of capital you have to do it with.</p>

<p class="mt2" id="FARMING_WORK"><b>Farming out the Work.&mdash;</b>In the beginning you
will often find it much cheaper, and hence more profitable,
to give a contract to some manufacturer&mdash;who
has a big factory fitted out with thousands of dollars
worth of machine tools and a capable force of skilled
mechanics&mdash;for a given number of the articles, or
machines, you want to have made and delivered in and
at a certain time.</p>

<p>By this arrangement there is no <i>initial</i> time, effort
or money spent on buying machinery and getting a
factory into running order, neither is there the work
and worry of keeping a shop force going and besides
you know exactly what each device will cost you when
the lot is done and delivered. Still this scheme is not
one that appeals to many inventors especially if they
have, or think they have, a genius for mechanics and
shop management.</p>

<p>Another way to start operations in an economical
manner is to have some one or all of the parts of your
invention done by outside manufacturers, or <i>farm them
out</i> as it is called, and then assemble the parts in your
own shop. Scattered all over the United States are
shops and all sorts of factories where you can get a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
lower price quoted on a certain part or parts made of
wood, brass, rubber or any other material than you
could possibly make it or them for, in a shop of your
own in the beginning.</p>

<p>Of course the larger the quantity of a given piece
you can order at a time the lower will be the <i>pro rata</i>
cost, that is the cost of each piece; for instance suppose
a brass founder quoted you a price of $1 each on a certain
casting in lots of ten, he might scale the price
down to 50 or 60 cents each in lots of one hundred, and
if you ordered a thousand at a time you might <i>get</i> the
price down to 35 or 40 cents each. In figuring cost
things like this must be taken into consideration.</p>

<p>In many cases it is not the mere material put into,
and labor put on making a part that brings up the cost
of the first lots but before the part can be turned out a
special <i>die</i>, or <i>jig</i>, or <i>fixture</i> must be made for duplicating
the part and very often a special machine must
be designed and built for making a certain part. Such
special tools and machines are very expensive and their
cost must also be reckoned with.</p>

<p class="mt2" id="STARTING_SHOP"><b>Starting Your Own Shop.&mdash;</b>In starting your own
shop the question of what you are going to make and
the quantity you intend to make will fix very largely
the kind of machinery, the floor space and everything
else you will need, nearly.</p>

<p>In this age of cheap electric power you can have
an electric motor installed, to run your lathes, drill
presses, shapers and other machines, almost anywhere
you happen to be located. And besides it is better, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
a rule, to start and operate your plant in your home
town. For a shop on a small scale, wherever it may
be, it is cleaner, less troublesome and cheaper to use
electric power than it is to use gas or steam power.</p>

<p>Should you intend to operate on a very large scale
it may then be to your advantage to look up a place
where there is water power, or if your industry is one
that calls for the large use of electricity you would then
be justified in moving to Niagara Falls, or some other
place where there are great hydro-electric plants.</p>

<p>The matter of being near to certain raw materials
you need for manufacturing, or to a market for your
product is not one that you will probably have to decide
alone. Nor need the question of labor take up
your time for the wages of skilled machinists, electricians
and chemists are about the same throughout
the United States, and while rents are higher in large
cities than in the towns and villages still nearly one-half
of the articles and machines made in the United
States are turned out in 100 of the largest cities.</p>

<p>One of the advantages of manufacturing in a large
city is that you can always get skilled labor and a great
variety of materials on short notice. Should your
product be in the nature of gas or steam engines,
harvesting machines or automobiles you should locate
your factory on some navigable river, on the Great
Lakes, or on a railroad line (with a spur-track running
alongside), in order to insure good and cheap
transportation.</p>

<p>When you rent or build a shop the main thing is to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
have plenty of windows on every side and see to it
that the ventilation is good and the heating system is
adequate. There is no economy in making men work
with poor light, bad air and in a cold place.</p>

<p class="mt2" id="BUYING_MACHINE"><b>Buying Machine Tools.&mdash;</b>Having secured by lease
or by purchase a shop, or factory suitably located your
next effort will be directed toward equipping it with
the proper tools and machinery.</p>

<p>Besides the usual machinists’ hand tools you should
buy (1) a <i>gas furnace</i>; (2) a <i>grinder</i>; (3) a <i>plain
lathe</i>; (4) a <i>screw cutting lathe</i>; (5) a <i>drill press</i>; (6)
a <i>planer</i>; (7) a <i>shaper</i>; (8) perhaps a <i>milling machine</i>,
and (9) a <i>buffer</i>. Several of each of these kinds of
machines may be needed.</p>

<p>A gas furnace, see Fig. 86, is useful for tempering
tools and other operations where an intense heat is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
needed. A grinder, shown in Fig. 87, is used for
grinding off rough parts of iron or brass castings and
for smoothing up rough surfaces. It is formed of a
<i>mandrel</i> which turns freely in a pair of bearings set in
a <i>headstock</i>. A pulley is fixed to the middle of the
mandrel and the latter is threaded on the ends; an
<i>emery</i>, or a <i>carborundum</i> wheel is slipped over each
end and these are held in place by washers and nuts.
A swivel <i>hand rest</i> makes it easy to hold the work
against the wheel.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 87.</span> <span class="smcap1">A GRINDER AND POLISHER</span></div>
</div>

<p>A plain lathe, see Fig. 88, is good for turning, drilling
and facing metal parts and for many other operations.
It consists of a bed supported on a frame which
carries the driving pulleys; the latter in turn is belted
to a <i>cone pulley</i> which is <i>keyed</i> to the mandrel and
this runs in bearings in the <i>headstock</i>. The inner end
of the mandrel projects beyond the bearing and this is
threaded so that a <i>chuck</i>, that is a device with adjustable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
jaws for holding the work, can be screwed on it.</p>

<p>Besides the headstock which carries the rotating
mandrel, and which is fixed on the left hand side of the
bed, there is a <i>tailstock</i> with an adjustable mandrel
which slides on the right hand end of the bed, and between
the headstock and the tailstock there is an adjustable
hand rest.</p>

</div>

<p>An engine lathe, as shown in Fig. 89, besides doing
all an ordinary lathe can do can be used for accurately
turning up cylinders, disks, etc., turning out cylinders
and cutting screws of any size or pitch, within certain
limits, and it does all these things with rapidity and precision.</p>

<p>A lathe of this kind has a <i>guide-screw</i>, a set of
<i>change wheels</i>, that is a number of interchangeable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
gears, and a <i>back-gear</i>, and by means of these gears
the guide-screw is revolved in any <i>ratio</i> to the speed
of the gears which may be desired. For turning or
cutting a <i>slide-rest</i> is used, that is an attachment sliding
between the headstock and the tailstock, for holding
the tools.</p>

<p>A drill press makes drilling an easier and a more

90. It is so constructed that the drill can be rotated
at any one of a number of speeds and by means of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>

flat surfaces, cutting slots and the like in metal parts.
A planer is made up of a <i>bed</i>, a <i>table</i> in which the
work is clamped and which slides back and forth on
the bed by means of a feed motion; a slide-rest, which
carries the cutting tool, is held above the bed by an

</div>

<p>There are several kinds of shapers made and Fig.
92 shows one of them. A shaper cannot only be
used for planing, but for turning, boring and slotting.
In a shaper the work is held in a fixed position on the
table, which can be raised and lowered by a hoisting
screw, and the tool is made to move across the table by
a quick-acting return motion.</p>

<p>There is also an <i>arbor</i> on which the work is mounted
where a circular cut is to be made. The cutter head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
has a vertical adjusting screw with a <i>worm feed</i> and
an index plate so that it can be set to any ratio. In a
shop where only small work is to be done a planer may
be dispensed with and a shaper used instead.</p>

<p>If you are buying new machines get them fitted with

will save shafting, the time and cost of putting it up,
the cost of belting, besides the time the machine is idle
while the belt is broken and it is being laced again, the
loss of power in transmission, when the machine is idle,
etc., etc.; boiled down, these machines equipped with

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 95.</span> <span class="smcap1">A BAND SAW FOR SAWING HEAVIER WOODWORK</span></div>
</div>

<p>Whatever machines you order be sure to also order
at the same time a full supply of tools to use with
them for otherwise you may find when you have your
machinery all set up and you think you are ready to
start that you are minus the cutting tools and should
this happen you will be in for another long delay.</p>

<p>Unless your product requires a lot of wood-work it
will hardly pay you to add a woodworking shop to your
plant, though sometimes a <i>jig-saw</i>, see Fig. 94, or a

service.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>It is the same way with a foundry, for unless you
need a large number of castings right along it is as a
rule cheaper to farm the work out to some founder
in your own town.</p>

<p class="mt2" id="BUYING_STOCK"><b>Buying the Stock.&mdash;</b>I do not mean the stock of
your company&mdash;let your friends and the public do
that&mdash;but the raw materials, as the <i>stock</i> is sometimes
called, which you are to convert into the finished
product.</p>

<p>Before you order either machinery or stock, try to
<i>standardize</i> your product, that is to say whatever it is
you intend to manufacture have it in such shape that
you are satisfied to market it without making any
further changes in it, at least for some time to come.
It is the after-changes, the constant changes that have
kept many a manufacturer poor, aye, forced him to
the wall.</p>

<p>Having a standardized article, object or machine,
you and your associates should determine on the number
to be built first and then you can go over the model
in detail and figure out just how much of each kind
of stock, such as brass rod, sheet hard rubber, screws,
washers, nuts, etc., you will need, allowing of course
for waste and breakage.</p>

<p>Now when you are ordering the tools and machines
for your shop get prices on and order your stock at
the same time and see to it you do not overlook any
little thing and so have to wait for something you forgot.</p>

<p>Screws, nuts, washers, bolts and some other small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
supplies can be bought in wholesale lots cheaper than
you could possibly make them in your own shop and it
is false economy to make anything with ordinary machine
tools that can be bought from some other manufacturer
who does the work with automatic machinery.</p>

<p class="mt2" id="ORGANIZING_SHOP"><b>Organizing a Shop Force.&mdash;</b>I am taking it for
granted that if you have enough ability to invent,
design and make a working model of an invention and
get an <i>organization</i> together to manufacture and
market it you will certainly have enough ability
left to build up and superintend the <i>body</i> of your enterprise
and that is your shop force.</p>

<p>Your first effort in this direction should be to hire
a good foreman; this, though, is not an easy thing to
do for a foreman must be something more than a
thorough machinist who can use any tool or run any
machine. He must be able to get the best there is in
them out of the other men under him and see that each
one is put on the job which he is best adapted to do.</p>

<p>Some of the men will shine as bench hands, others
will show an aptitude in running machine tools and yet
again others will be naturally clever in assembling your
device; he must be able to pick out these good qualities
and put the men where they will do the best work
in the shortest time.</p>

<p>By all means get a foreman, if you can, who has
worked on something like, or nearly like, your own
product. He should be a man of shop ideas with
enough <i>initiative</i> to put them into use. To get all
these things rolled into one human being for $25, $30<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
or $35 dollars a week is asking a good deal but there
are boss machinists in almost every city who can fill
the bill.</p>

<p>Your foreman can usually get all the mechanics you
need but don’t make the mistake of starting in
and letting him hire the men. After he has found a
man and wants to take him on, then you talk to the
prospective employee, and you do the hiring. Hiring
and <i>firing</i> the men should be your <i>prerogative</i>. This
will make all of them respect you without respecting
their foreman the less and they will do more and better
work by knowing that you are the real boss of the
works.</p>

<p class="mt2" id="STOCK_ROOM"><b>The Stock Room.&mdash;</b>The tools that belong to the
shop and the stock, or raw materials, should be kept
under lock and key in the stock-room and a stock-clerk
should be put in charge of and made responsible for
them.</p>

<p>Have slips printed and whenever the foreman, or
anybody else, including yourself, wants a drill, or a
piece of brass, or a machine screw, insist that the stock-clerk
get a slip signed for it. By this method you will
know exactly where your tools and stock went to;
and when a man returns a tool credit him with it.</p>

<p>You should also have a record kept of the time spent
on each job by the man who did the work and the
easiest way to do this is to use a time-stamp as
shown in Fig. 96. If your shop is a small one your
stock-clerk can take care of the time-slips. By doing
things in this systematized way you will be able to keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
pretty close tab on tools, stock and labor and these
are three <i>factors</i> where a great deal of waste usually
occurs in small shops and factories.</p>

</div>

<p class="mt2" id="FINISHED_PRODUCT"><b>The Finished Product.&mdash;</b>Whatever you are manufacturing,
the finished product must be made as attractive
as can be with the littlest extra cost and this applies
alike to a toaster for a gas-stove or a threshing-machine.
It’s the finish the buyer sees and he will
gladly pay for the paint and the gloss that covers up
the defects, if the thing looks nice.</p>

<p>Where a number of different materials enter into
the make-up of a device it is always well to give some
thought not only to the design,<span class="fnanchor"><a href="#FN_5" id="FNA_5">[5]</a></span> but also to the color
effect.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 97.</span> <span class="smcap1">A HIGH FREQUENCY MACHINE</span></div>
</div>

<p>Figure 97 shows a <i>high frequency</i> (violet ray) electric<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
machine designed by the author in which this idea
is carried out. The stand is of iron, nickle-plated; the
base of the apparatus proper is of wood, japanned
black; the rim is of brass, nickle-plated; the plate-base,
on which the visible part of the apparatus is mounted,
is made of slate and japanned black; the metal parts
of the interruptor are nickle-plated, and the coil and
insulating standards are of hard rubber as is also the
handle. The cover shade and the violet ray vacuum
tube are of glass, while red or green flexible silk cords<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
are used to make the connections, and finally the lamp
socket is of a composition called <i>electrose</i>.</p>

<p>Thus the color scheme is polished ebony, the wood
base, the slate plate base, hard rubber fittings and
electrose socket all appearing precisely alike; the blue-white
nickle-plated parts alternate with the black, the
glass lends an added touch of beauty while the red,
or green, cords give it a dash of color that relieves and
sets off the other parts.</p>

<p>Iron work can be <i>japanned</i> black, <i>enameled</i> any
color, or nickle-plated; brass can be lacquered or nickle-plated,
and wood can be enameled. After the device
or machine is assembled it should be rubbed up to remove
all finger marks and to brighten it, then wrapped
in tissue paper and packed carefully in a box if it is
small enough so that this can be done, or it must be
crated in such a way that it can be transported without
marring or breakage.</p>

<p class="mt2" id="OVERHEAD"><b>Overhead Charges.&mdash;</b>In figuring on the cost of a
completed device, machine or product so that a selling
price may be put on it which will insure a handsome
profit the cost of the stock, of the breakage of tools,
of the labor, or production, and of the power&mdash;gas,
electricity, water or coal&mdash;are all easy to keep
track of.</p>

<p>But there are other costs that must be taken into account
which, while they do not stick out so plainly must
also be reckoned with, or your venture will be a money
losing one. These are the <i>overhead</i> charges, such as
the <i>depreciation</i> of your machinery, that is the wear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
and tear of it; the rental of your factory, or the taxes
if you own the building; the insurance on the building
and the machinery; transportation costs such as teams
and teamsters or automobile trucks and drivers; telephone
calls and the other little and big items of expense&mdash;all
of these must be carefully thought up and
worked out for the year and charged against the number
of machines you are going to make in that year.</p>

<p>To these fixed and variable charges must be added
the salaries of yourself and your associates and the office
staff together with the printing bills, advertising
accounts and all the incidental expenses of maintaining
an executive office. Divide the total running expenses
for the year by the number of machines you
have turned out in a year and you will have the net
cost of each article or machine you have produced.</p>

<p class="mt2" id="PROFITS"><b>Where Your Profits Come In.&mdash;</b>Add 33⅓ per
cent., 100 per cent., or 500 per cent. to the cost of production
and let that be your selling price to <i>consumers</i>,
agents, jobbers or wholesalers, less the usual small discount
for cash. And the difference between the cost
of production and your selling price will be your <i>profits</i>
less certain losses on accounts which even an agency
can’t collect.</p>

<h2 id="CHAP_IX">CHAPTER IX<br />
PUTTING IT ON THE MARKET</h2>


<p>Long before you get your shop into running condition
and you are able to fill orders, you and your associates
will have talked over the best way that should
be adopted to put your article or machine on the
market so that it will bring in the largest returns in
the shortest time.</p>

<p>Here again the method you will choose and use will
depend on what you have to sell and the backing you
have to sell it with. Just as there are only seven original
jokes and all the others that you see and hear are
worked over and out of them so, too, there are only a
few <i>basic principles</i> in the art of selling goods but
these are modified into a thousand and one schemes.</p>

<p class="mt2" id="HOW_BEST"><b>How Best to Do It.&mdash;</b>How? Aye, that’s the
question! But even as you have had the genius to invent
a new and useful time, labor and money saving
device&mdash;there will, among the men you have surrounded
yourself with, rise up one whose brains teems
with schemes of ways and means to dispose of the factory’s
output at the greatest profit and you may have
a few stray ideas too as to how the thing can best be
done.</p>

<p>In every business however small or large there
should be frequent <i>conferences</i> of the partners, or of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
the heads of departments, and to save time and to
conserve energy it is better that these meetings should
be held at certain times each week, or oftener, when all
of the matters of the office and shop can be discussed
freely and threshed out. Indeed it is the common
practice of every business concern where there are a
number of departments for the heads of them to get
together every day in conference to learn the viewpoints
of the others.</p>

<p>By this method every one knows exactly where the
business stands for that day not only in his own department
but in the other fellow’s as well and he conducts
his part of it accordingly. This welds the whole
business into an efficient unit instead of having it made
up of a bunch of straggling ends. If the business
can’t be put on a paying basis under such favorable
conditions then you had better get a new partner, hire a
new manager or call in the old sheriff.</p>

<p class="mt2" id="AGENTS_WANTED"><b>Agents Wanted.&mdash;</b>Hundreds of small patented inventions
as, for instance broom hangers, pinless clothes
lines and burglar alarm traps are sold by the manufacturers
of them directly to small agents all over the
country and who, in turn, sell them by making a house
to house canvass. See Fig. 98.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>The amount of your sales under this plan will depend
on the number of agents you are able to secure
and generally on the persuasive ability of the rhinoceros
skinned peripatetic to sell the good housewife
something which she truly doesn’t want. But should
your invention be one of exceeding merit&mdash;and of
course it is&mdash;then the path of the itinerant salesman
is made glad and he sees a rose for every prick of the
thorn he gets.</p>

<p>Agents can be had by running small ads in the daily
and Sunday papers in the large cities under the classified
head of <i>Agents Wanted</i>. There are advertising
agents who will <i>run</i> an ad for you in 15 or 20 papers
throughout the United States, whose combined circulation
runs up into the millions of copies and all for a
$10 bill. An ad of this kind can also be run in such
magazines as <i>Popular Mechanics</i>, <i>Popular Science</i> and
a dozen other like publications.</p>

<p class="mt2" id="MAIL_ORDER"><b>The Mail Order Business.&mdash;</b>The two chief plans
for working a mail order business are (1) by selling
direct from your shop to the consumer and (2) by selling
your product to agents whom you start in the
mail order business.</p>

<p>To work the first plan there are two ways by which
you can get the names of prospective buyers and these
are (a) by running small ads in the papers and magazines
and (b) by buying a list of the names of firms
who make a business of classifying and selling them.</p>

<p>Regarding the first plan suppose you have invented
a new <i>blood testing apparatus</i> in which case you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
couldn’t possibly hope to sell it to any other class than
doctors. Now you can buy a list of all of the doctors
in Boston, or of any other city, in Illinois or any other
State, or of all of them in the whole United States
from <i>Boyd’s City Dispatch</i>, 19 Beekman Street; <i>Rapid
Addressing Machine Company</i>, 374 Broadway, and
R. L. Polk and Co., Inc., 87 Third Avenue, all of New
York City.</p>

<div id="FIG_99" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_b_169.png" width="450" height="95" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 99.</span> <span class="smcap1">FROM THE MANUFACTURER TO THE ORDER AGENT, THENCE TO THE CONSUMER</span></div>
</div>

<p>When you get this list you can then send out to each
doctor a nicely gotten up <i>folder</i> or <i>booklet</i> and a clearly
worded letter, which you can have <i>mimeographed</i>, that
is duplicates made from the original typewritten letter,
and according to business rules and regulations these
ought to make a noise like a lot of orders.</p>

<p>Lists of men and women in every line of business,
profession and trade; including R. S. Dun and Company’s
list which is guaranteed 99 per cent. accurate,
can be bought of the above concerns that are classified
to fit whatever article or device you intend to
market. This is one way of conducting a mail-order
selling campaign.</p>

<p>The second plan as outlined above is to run small
two to ten line classified ads for agents offering to
start them in the mail order business. See Fig. 100.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>Your proposition to each prospective agent who replies
is something like this: you will give him, provided
he buys, for cash in advance, of course, one dozen, one
gross, or a dozen gross of the product you manufacture,
the exclusive territory of a city, a county, or several
of them, or of an entire State as you choose and
according to the quantity he buys.</p>

<p>Included in the price he pays, you furnish him with
so many letter heads and envelopes with his name
printed thereon as <i>manufacturer’s agent</i>; printed circulars
or folders, a <i>series of follow-up letters</i> and whatever
else is needed to start him in the mail order business
except the list of names and the postage stamps he
will use. It is up to him to get these accessories.</p>

<p class="mt2" id="FOLLOW_UP"><b>A Series of Follow-up Letters.&mdash;</b>By a series of
follow-up letters is meant that a number of different
letters, say six, are written up in such a way that each
one makes a stronger appeal to the consumer than the
one he gets before.</p>

<p>Let’s say that your agent sends a circular describing
the merits of your <i>patent mailing box for eggs</i> to an
egg grower in the rural district and with it a letter
stating how glad he would be to receive an order from
him for a dozen mailing boxes, the price, etc.; if, now,
in ten days’ time no reply is forth-coming the agent
mails him a second letter, stating that he can’t understand
why he hasn’t heard from him, et cetera and so
on. If this brings no response the agent mails a third
letter in another ten days saying that since he (the
agent) has used several stamps in writing to him suppose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
that he (the egg grower) sits down and uses a
stamp on him and so forth and <i>e pluribus unum</i>, as
Artemus Ward used to say.</p>

<p>And so the letters are mailed until the series of six
have been sent out at ten day intervals. The idea is
that as the letters, each of which is a little stronger
than the one before it, reach the egg grower with
clocklike regularity the value of your patent mailing
box for eggs will sink deeper and with more telling effect
into his <i>cranium</i> and that somewhere between the
first and the last letter he will conclude he had
better order a dozen or more boxes.</p>

<p>If the sixth and last letter does not bring an order
the agent may then conclude that the chickens are dead,
or that the roosters are sleeping, or else that the egg-grower
doesn’t want the mailing box and he knows
that he doesn’t want it. At any rate it is time for the
agent to quit wasting stamps on him.</p>

<p class="mt2" id="SELLING_AGENTS"><b>Selling Through Sales Agents.&mdash;</b>Turning now to
big business one of the most successful ways now in
vogue to sell goods is the one adopted by automobile
manufacturers.</p>

<p>By this method the manufacturer sells his product
to his own sales agents and these in turn sell them
to the consumer. Both the manufacturer and his
agents advertise, the former nationally, that is he tries
to reach all the people, and the latter locally, that is in
his own territory.</p>

<p>The result of their joint advertising is inquiries
and these the sales agent follows up by personal solicitation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
Fig. 100 shows diagrammatically how the
scheme works out.</p>

<p class="mt2" id="SELLING_FACTORY"><b>Selling Direct from Factory to Consumer.&mdash;</b>A
large number of manufacturing concerns have built up
profitable businesses by advertising in various publications
and dealing directly with the consumer. See Fig.
101.</p>

<div id="FIG_100" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_b_172.png" width="450" height="233" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 100.</span> <span class="smcap1">FROM THE MANUFACTURER TO THE MANUFACTURER’S AGENT, THENCE TO THE CONSUMER</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Many products, especially those in the nature of
machines, can be sold by this method where they could
not be marketed in any other way. Take as an example
the larger sizes of hand power printing presses.
One firm has sold thousands of these machines through
the persistent use of small advertisements where only a
few could have been disposed of through dealers of
any kind, for the reason that there is not a sufficient
demand for them in any one locality.</p>

<p>Any article, device or machine can be sold directly
to the people through the medium of cleverly displayed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
advertisements placed in the right publications. When
you get ready for an advertising campaign write to any
advertising agent&mdash;and he also advertises&mdash;telling
him what it is you have to sell and he will send you a
list of the periodicals which will reach the class of
folks who will be interested in your commodity and
also quote you advertising rates. But of advertising
I shall have something more to say later on.</p>

<div id="FIG_101" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_b_173.png" width="400" height="200" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 101.</span> <span class="smcap1">SELLING DIRECT FROM THE FACTORY TO THE CONSUMER</span></div>
</div>

<p>Where you sell direct to the consumer you should
also use, of course, a series of attractive <i>pictorial</i>
cards, circulars, folders and booklets which describe
your offering in terms of glowing color and cold, hard
facts. Don’t try to deceive your customers for no
business can be conducted on misrepresentation and
last, and besides it is just as easy to enthuse with the
truth as it is to equivocate, <i>not to use a harsher and
uglier word</i>.<span class="fnanchor"><a href="#FN_6" id="FNA_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>A series of follow-up letters should also be used and
lists of the people you want to reach are sometimes as
useful, and occasionally more so, in bringing results<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
as advertising. In fact every art and device known to
the system of business should be freely used where
there are no middlemen.</p>

<p class="mt2" id="SELLING_TRADE"><b>Selling Through the Trade.&mdash;</b>The older plan for
a large manufacturer to dispose of his goods is through
the retail stores, but this is a more costly and a harder
way than by the direct method of reaching the consumer.</p>

<p>The reason for this is that the manufacturer does
not deal directly with the retailer, but must do so
through a lot of middlemen of whom there are in some
cases not less than three and often more.</p>

<div id="FIG_102" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_b_174.png" width="450" height="145" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 102.</span> <span class="smcap1">SELLING THROUGH THE TRADE</span></div>
</div>

<p>Figure 102 shows how many different concerns stand
between the manufacturer and those who buy his
goods; the manufacturer turns his product over to
the <i>commission man</i> who unloads it on the <i>jobber</i> or
<i>wholesaler</i>, who sends <i>drummers</i> on the road, who
make the <i>retailer</i> buy it, who hands it out over the
counter to his <i>customers</i>, who are merely acquaintances
of his.</p>

<p>All of the middlemen make big profits while the
manufacturer and the retailer have to be satisfied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
with a very small margin and the consumer knows
that he is paying several prices too many for the article
he buys.</p>

<p>The advantage, though, of handling your product
through middlemen lies in the fact that you can very
often get a commission man, or a jobber, to contract
for the entire output of your factory, and sometimes
a certainty of this kind with small fixed profits is better
than taking a chance of putting a large sum into
advertising with the uncertainty of large profits or of
no profits at all.</p>

<p class="mt2" id="PUBLICITY"><b>Getting Publicity.&mdash;</b>Going back once more to the
time when you have completed your model and your
patent has just been granted, it is often a good idea to
give some <i>publicity</i> to your invention.</p>

<p>By publicity I mean to get some <i>write-ups</i> in the
papers and some articles in the magazines and if you
go about it the right way it will not cost you anything
for space and sometimes the editors will even pay you
for your contributions.</p>

<p>When you have reached the stage where you want
some publicity write up a clear description of say 500,
1000 or 2000 words, depending on the importance and
intricacy of your invention, and have a typewritten copy
made of it; next have some good 5 by 7, or better,
8 by 10 photographs made of your model from different
viewpoints. Small kodak pictures are of no value in
obtaining free publicity for clean-cut, large pictures,
count for as much or more with the average editor
than either subject matter or written copy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>Now the kind of publications in which you will want
your article to appear will hinge on the class of readers
who will be interested in it. But let’s suppose that it
is a new machine, or a new electrical apparatus of some
sort or other. If it is a machine send your typewritten
article to the editor of the <i>Scientific American</i>, Woolworth
Building, New York; if your photos and article
appeal to the editor as being new and novel he will
most certainly print them in his paper.</p>

<p>In an article of this kind it is not good policy to
crack up yourself or put in your street number, as this
savors too much of trying to get a page or so of advertising
in the body of the paper free of charge; your
name and the city where you live are enough to include
in the article, but in a letter accompanying the
latter you can send your detailed address. And you
can send in another article and photos to the <i>Engineering
Magazine</i>, 140 Nassau Street, New York; <i>Machinery</i>,
140 Lafayette Street, New York, and other
publications of a like character.</p>

<p>Should your invention be electrical, or have a single
electric element connected with it, send your article to
the <i>Electrical World</i>, 239 West 39th Street and to the
<i>Electrical Review</i>, 13 Park Row, both of New York,
and the editors of either of these publications will most
surely and gladly accommodate you with space for your
contribution.</p>

<p>The purpose of having articles appear in these <i>technical</i>
papers is not so much to sell your product as it is
to give you an <i>authentic</i> article in a standard publication<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
which you can refer to and reprint from for distribution
to those whom you may want to interest
either as partners or shareholders. Reprints are also
useful for <i>circularizing</i> agents or consumers after you
have your factory in shape to take care of the orders.</p>

<p>Should your invention have to do with mining send
in your article and photographs to the mining papers,
if it is in the notion line mail it to the dry-goods papers
and so on for no matter what you have invented you
will find one or more trade papers in that particular
field who will give you the desired publicity.</p>

<p>After some good technical, or trade paper has published
an account of your invention the daily and
weekly papers in your home-town are apt to be impressed
with the importance of what you have done
and one or all of them will give you quite a write-up.</p>

<p class="mt2" id="ADVERTISING"><b>Advertising.&mdash;</b>While publicity and advertising are
one and the same thing in that both of them make
known to the great body of buyers the merits of your
invention I have <i>arbitrarily</i> divided them into two
classes calling (1) everything that is printed as straight
reading matter in a paper and free of charge <i>publicity</i>
and (2) all that is displayed to attract the attention of
the reader and paid for at space rates as <i>advertising</i>.</p>

<p>You can begin an advertising campaign with a very
small outlay of capital by running a ½ inch, one
column wide ad in ten or a dozen papers or magazines
as a starter. To have your ad <i>displayed</i> as you want
it, that is the style of type and the illustration that goes
with it, get your local printer to set it up and have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
as many <i>electrotypes</i> made from it as there are papers
you intend to buy space in. Then all you have to do
is to mail one of these electrotypes to the publisher and
it appears in his paper exactly like the type from which
it was made and it can be used over and over again.</p>

<p>This <i>stereotyped</i> kind of an ad which meets the
reader’s eye in nearly every publication he picks up
will finally get through the pores of the calcium salts
which form his skull and impress the sensitive area of
his brain, or, to use the language Evelyn doesn’t like,
it <i>gets on his nerves</i> and he will read it. Every time
he sees it after that he will remember its message and
then when the <i>psychological moment</i> arrives and he
wants your product he will send to you either for a
catalogue and price-list or for the thing itself.</p>

<p>Larger ads should have the reading matter and the
cut changed frequently, but it is always well to use
some design, or a name (see <a href="#CHAP_XII">Chapter XII</a>), which
stands out boldly in relief so that it will flag the attention
of the reader immediately he turns to the page
where it is displayed. The rest of the ad must then be
catchy enough to induce him, or her, who sees it to
read it, and last of all it should contain some gem or
germ of knowledge which he, or she, will carry away
and think over and always to the end for which your
ad was written and designed&mdash;and that is to buy your
product.</p>

<p>Writing alluring ads requires inventive ability but
of an order very different from that which produces
a new machine. Hence there are inventors who make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
a specialty of writing ads but they are content to call
themselves originators.</p>

<p>Should you have a product that you intend to give
wide publicity to, whether it is your intention to sell
to the consumer direct or to sell to him through the
retail trade, it is a good plan to engage the services of
an advertising firm to conduct the campaign for you.</p>

<p>If you are going to spend $1,000 or $100,000 on
making your product known among men and women
and popularizing it so that everybody will buy it, or
wants to buy it, it is well to have an advertising agent
or firm get up the ads, place them in the papers where
they will do the most good&mdash;in a word engineer the
whole thing for you while you are superintending your
factory and your partner is taking care of the orders&mdash;then
all you have got to do is to count the <i>shekels</i>
that roll in or out as the case may be.</p>

<h2 id="CHAP_X">CHAPTER X<br />
THINGS FOR YOU TO INVENT</h2>


<p>All through this book I have done my best to
nickelplate you in the bath of my own experience and
I believe I have made everything clear unless it is just
how to get the big idea.</p>

<p>And even if I could give you a hard and fast rule
for thinking up new and novel things I have grave
fears I would be tempted to keep that bit of information
to myself and start up an <i>idea factory</i> in opposition
to Edison.</p>

<p>But while it is not yet possible to lay down a law
for the creation of an original idea it may prove of
some value to tell you something about what is needed
both small and large and this in itself may serve to
stimulate your thought centers to activity.</p>

<p>As you look about and see all the different materials,
apparatus and machines that have been invented to
make work easier, to save time or goods and to increase
safety and comfort you may on first thought
conclude that everything the human race really needs
has been invented and this is in a large measure true.</p>

<p>But the secret of present day inventing was let out
of the bag by Edison when he said that “hardly any
piece of machinery now manufactured is more than 10<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
per cent. perfect.” Certainly the electric lights we
now have are good enough as far as the light goes but
light costs us ten times as much as it ought to cost for
the reason that 90 per cent. of the energy there is in a
ton of coal is wasted and only 10 per cent. of it is
transformed into actual light.</p>

<p>Oliver Lodge, England’s greatest electrician, once
said that if we knew how the glow worm makes his
light then a boy could turn a machine that would develop
enough electricity to light a factory. The problem
for you to tackle then is not to make a <i>better</i> light
but to make a <i>cheaper</i> light.</p>

<p>And what Edison has said about machines and
Lodge has said about light, I say is just as true of
everything else we have for lessening labor, for saving
time and materials, making for safety and adding to
comfort. Everything that has been invented up to the
present time, with very few exceptions, such as the
electric motor which is 98 per cent. efficient, can be
made nearly 90 per cent. better.</p>

<p>This gives you your cue for inventing, that is to
conceive and <i>improve</i> upon what has been done rather
than to sap your life’s blood and waste time, which is
just as precious if you only know it, in trying to invent
something entirely new and original under the shining
sun.</p>

<p>Nor do you need to undertake to improve upon the
big things&mdash;unless, of course, you get a great idea
and you feel that the world can’t get along without it
and that you would lose a fortune unless you straightaway<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
developed it. Otherwise just keep your eagle
eye on the lookout and your inventive brain cells on the
alert and it will not be long before you will see something
where there is room for improvement.</p>

<p class="mt2" id="LITTLE_THINGS"><b>Some Little Things Needed.&mdash;</b><i>For the Person.</i>&mdash;There
isn’t a thing you wear, or carry in your pockets,
or use in making your toilet but which can be improved
upon.</p>

<p>Your suspenders, your corset, cuff buttons, dress-shields,
necktie clasp, hose supports, garters, hat pins,
collar buttons, eye glasses and eye-glass guards, hair
curlers or straighteners according to the dictates of
fashion, jewelry guards, fasteners for clothing, clothes
hangers and clothes presses ought all to be done over
and re-invented.</p>

bookkeeping machines; see Fig. 106.</p>

<p id="FUN"><i>For Fun.</i>&mdash;There is a great demand for toys and
amusement devices and novelties of all kinds.</p>

<p>Little 5 and 10 cent jokes, like the snake jar, shadow
dancer, shooting pack of cards, rubber dagger, see Fig.
107, and the musical seat, puzzles like the beast, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
star and crescent, Billy Possum, devil lock and Chinese
conjuring rings and games, tricks, magical advertising
novelties and the like are profitable in a small and
sometimes in a big way.</p>

</div>

<p>Merry-go-round, shoot-the-chutes, bump-the-bumps,
see Fig. 108, dips and slides are some of the larger
amusement inventions that have been making money
at summer and seaside resorts. What you must do is
to provide other new and novel means for the fun loving
people to do ridiculous stunts and pay you for the
privilege.</p>

<p>Now while all of the above devices have been invented
and patented the point is that every one of
them has a <i>bug</i>, that is a flaw in it somewhere; by
which I mean that in each and every case, except the
toys and amusements, the device is too hard to work,
costs too much, takes too much time, is too troublesome,
is too poorly made or is not as comfortable as
the old-fashioned thing.</p>

<p>It is your business as an inventor to improve it so
that your device will do the work or serve the purpose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
better than it has ever been done before. In order to
improve a compound, device or machine to this extent
you will have to introduce some new principle, or element
into it and it is this added cause, or part in <i>combination</i>
with the other and well-known arrangements
that gives it a new and novel twist and for which you
pray that letters patent may be granted.</p>

<p class="mt2" id="BIG_INVENTIONS"><b>Some Big Inventions Needed.&mdash;</b><i>Safety First.</i>&mdash;That
there were 38,000 deaths, 500,000 seriously injured
and 2,000,000 slightly injured persons caused by
all manner of accidents in 1915, shows how badly improvements
are needed for all kinds of machinery,
in the operation of mines, railroads and steamships and
in the manufacture of certain chemical products such
as phosphorus matches and dynamite. There is money
and lots of it in inventions that have for their object
the safeguarding of human health, limb and life. Fig.
109 shows a life-saving gun.</p>

<p id="AUTOMOBILES"><i>Automobiles.</i>&mdash;The automobile is the speed machine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
of to-day. Pneumatic tires, transmission gears
and differentials, must go for they are bothersome,
complicated and costly. An engine without poppet
valves, carburetor, high tension ignition system and
water cooling system with its expensive radiator would
be most welcome. A magnetic clutch that does away
with the transmission gears is shown in Fig. 110.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 110.</span> <span class="smcap1">THE OWEN MAGNETIC CLUTCH</span></div>
</div>

<p>A cheap substitute for gasoline is heartily to be
hoped for and inventors are searching for it now.
The engine of the future will be driven by some high
explosive mixture each ingredient of which will be perfectly
harmless in itself but when the fractional part of
a drop of each chemical is mixed with the other in the
cylinder of the engine they will combine and explode
violently.</p>

<p id="AVIATION"><i>Aviation.</i>&mdash;The aeroplane is the speed machine of
to-morrow. The great requirement of the present
time in the flying machine is <i>inherent stability</i>, which
means that it is so designed that it will not overturn,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
or if overturned it will right itself of its own accord.
Fig. 111 shows a gyro-stabilizer for this purpose.</p>

</div>

<p>After stability the next most desirable improvement
needed in an aeroplane is one that will make it rise from
the ground at a far larger angle from the horizontal,
that is fly more nearly straight up than those that are
built at the present time. A better engine, an easier
way of starting and a surer way of alighting, are next
in order.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p id="CHEMISTRY"><i>Chemistry.</i>&mdash;There are unlimited possibilities in
chemistry for making big inventions. A method to
produce cheap liquid air, see Fig. 112, would revolutionize
many industries. Radium which is worth $1,000,000
a pound, or thereabouts, is plentiful in nature
and requires some simpler method only for its cheap
extraction. But both of the above are very hard
things to do.</p>

<p><i>Artificial</i> milk, tea, coffee and eggs, the extraction of
<i>caffeine</i> from coffee, <i>thein</i> from tea and <i>nicotine</i> from
tobacco&mdash;which are the harmful chemicals in these
products, a cheap method of producing artificial ice, or
refrigeration without ice, a substance to <i>denature</i> alcohol
are only a few of the things to be invented in chemistry.</p>

<p><i>Synthetic chemistry</i>, that is the artificial production<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
of real rubber, camphor, diamonds, rubies and other
precious stones, dye-stuffs and other products heretofore
supplied only by nature, also offers a large and
fascinating field for the inventive chemist.</p>

<p id="ELECTRICITY"><i>Electricity.</i>&mdash;There are hundreds, if not thousands
of electrical inventors who are busier than a swarm of
bees in a field of clover, but there is enough left for
all of them and as many more to do if they worked in
eight hour shifts until the dawn of the millennium.</p>

<p>An apparatus for dispelling fogs by electricity, television,
or transmitting sight by electricity, cheap electric
lights, see Fig. 113, a simple telautograph, or writing
telegraph, a means for directing wireless telegraph
and telephone messages, automatic block signals which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
operate in the engine driver’s cab and are positive in
action, transmitting pictures by wireless and a cheap
and powerful generator of sustained electric oscillations
by a battery or other low voltage current, all these
needs show that there is still plenty of room for improvement.</p>



<p id="ELECTRO_CHEMISTRY"><i>Electro-Chemistry.</i>&mdash;In this field of endeavor the
things that are needed would fill a large book and many
things that will come have not even been dreamed of
yet.</p>

<p>A few that I can think of is a self-charging primary
battery, a light weight storage battery, a way to produce
electricity direct from coal, a scheme to prevent
<i>electrolysis</i> in underground pipes, the <i>electrification</i> of
farming lands to make forty bushels of rye grow
where only one was sown, see Fig. 114, to store up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
electrical energy from the sun and the production of
entirely new and unheard of substances in the electric

<p id="BUILDING"><i>Building.</i>&mdash;In the building line heating, ventilation
and drainage are all open to great improvement.
Glass that can be bent to shape and which cannot be
so easily broken is much needed while fireproof materials
and fire protection leave much to the inventor to
perfect. Even improvements are needed for wrecking
buildings as will be seen in Fig. 115.</p>

<p id="MINING"><i>Mining and Metallurgy.</i>&mdash;Safety appliances are of
the first importance in mine inventions, see Fig. 116,
and after these, machines for labor saving should receive
attention. If you understand mining, be it for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
coal, metals or gems, you will see that there is yet much
to be done to make the operations safer, more saving
and less laborious.</p>

<br />It records the presence of gas</div>
</div>

<p>After the ore is mined, the metal must be separated
from it and this is largely a matter of chemistry and
mechanical devices. <i>Saving</i> is the watchword for the
inventor who would improve the present methods and
processes. If you can show how a saving of metal
can be effected or how the same amount can be extracted
more cheaply you are the boy the owners are
looking for and you can name your own price, nearly.</p>

<p>An alloy for armor which will deflect projectiles,
steel rolls which will roll and straighten sheets and rails
with one handling, a process for extracting metals
from low grade ores, a process for making small brass,
iron or steel castings in much the same manner that a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
linotype machine casts a type slug, are all improvements
for you to think about even if you don’t try to
invent them.</p>

<p id="PRINTING"><i>Printing.</i>&mdash;The noble art of printing has been
brought to such a high degree of perfection it would
seem to leave little to be invented. But like all the
arts and sciences there is yet much to be done.</p>

<br />One boy does the work of four men</div>
</div>

<p>A few gentle hints in this direction is the need of a
three color printing press, machines for engraving steel
plates, see Fig. 117, and presses for printing from
them, power copper plate presses, printing without ink
by means of electricity and bookbinding, electrotyping
and typefoundry processes and machinery; all these,
and many more need looking into.</p>

<p id="MOVING_PICTURES"><i>Moving Pictures.</i>&mdash;Three great improvements must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
be made in the moving picture industry before it will
take on anything like perfection, and these are (1) a
film that is not easily broken, is as transparent as
glass and is fire proof; (2) pictures that are photographed
on the film and projected on the screen in
their natural colors, and (3) moving pictures that are
made and projected on the principle of the <i>stereoscope</i>
so that the picture will stand out true to life in
color, time and space. The last word in moving picture
machines at this writing is shown in Fig. 118.</p>

</div>

<p>All of the above improvements have been made but
they are each of them very crude and they must be re-improved
to a very great extent before they can be
successfully shown in theaters. I do not believe any
attempt has yet been made to combine the three features
in a single machine.</p>

<p><i>Other Fields of Endeavor.</i>&mdash;There are many other
fields that are just as full of promise for the inventor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
as those I have cited and among them may be named
railways and steamships, boilers and engines, bridge
building, munitions of war, textile and boot and shoe
machinery, medical and dental apparatus and instruments,
devices for the postal service, musical instruments,
vending machines and the utilization of by-products.
Verily there is everything under the heavens
for you to improve if you will but find out a new
means, devise a scheme, discover by art, contrive by
ingenuity or, in a nutshell, originate an idea, work it
out, patent it and beat the other fellow to it.</p>

small means and are without tools it were better not to
get too big an idea for your first invention. Try out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
your genius on some simple thing, that is if you can.</p>

<p>Of course should some great improvement strike
you it would be folly to drop it simply because you
happened to be handicapped in two or three several
little ways. When in such a predicament you must
rise above the level of mediocrity and circumstance and
invent a plan to raise the necessary funds to go ahead
with your experimental work.</p>

</div>

<p>But whether you have or have not the quick capital
of your own to draw on there are some things you
should not try to invent&mdash;that is if you are an inventor
for the financial profits you expect to accrue
from your work. If you are doing it purely as a
scientist that is a horse of quite another color and
some scientific society may present you with a medal
in a plush lined case and its <i>Transactions</i> will laud you
for your unselfish work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>Such schemes as extracting gold from the salt water
of the sea, milking electricity directly from the ether,
blowing up ships at a distance by means of invisible
waves, making a <i>phonotypograph</i> which will, when
spoken into, print what you have said on a sheet of
paper, printing without type by means of the X-rays,
sending wireless messages to Mars and the wireless
transmission of power, see Fig. 119, are all good
things to let alone.</p>

<p>Not because these innovations are impossible to invent&mdash;they
will all come into general use some day&mdash;but
because it is not given to any inventor to work
a single one of them out alone and so I say don’t
try to unless you are a real Simon pure scientist.</p>

<h2 id="CHAP_XI">CHAPTER XI<br />
WHAT SOME INVENTIONS HAVE PAID</h2>


<p>One of the most alluring and sky-blue delights,
next to working out a big idea of your own, is to read
about the fortunes that other inventors have piled up
by the simple use of their <i>grey matter</i>.</p>

<p>The stories of what they did and how they did it are
far redder blooded and more gripping than any old
sleuth yarn ever put between paper covers; but different
from this kind of yellow fiction they are all true,
their heroes are all real and each one had a great idea
burning in his brain, like St. Elmo’s fire, and each had
the business ability to transmute it into solid gold,
twenty-four carats fine.</p>

<p>And it is not time wasted in harking back to what
other inventors have done if you will but heed the
lesson that they teach for their works stand out like
guide-posts by day and signal-lights by night which
point the way for you to go and do the same thing if
you will only quit dreaming, get busy with your experiments
and be careful not to run into any open switches.</p>

<p class="mt2" id="TOUR"><b>A Tour of the Inventive World.&mdash;</b>Nor need an invention
be a large one to make money though of course
the great inventions&mdash;those that have given the world
all the civilization it has had or is likely to have for
some centuries to come&mdash;have, as a rule, been the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
greatest producers of wealth for those who worked
them out.</p>

<p>So now suppose we make a personally conducted
tour around the world of inventions and take a look at
a few of the wonders which prove that <i>thoughts are
things</i> and that <i>things are money</i>, that is when you
know how to convert one into the other. And the
route we will take will show us some small inventions
as we go and we will see a few of the big inventions on
our return to home and laboratory.</p>

<p class="mt2" id="LITTLE_INVENTIONS"><b>Little Inventions.&mdash;</b>To begin with let us lead off
with the smallest and least important inventions,
though they also serve a purpose, and these are to be
found in toys, games and other things for pleasure.</p>

<p>First is the return ball, which consisted of a piece
of rubber strand fastened to a wooden ball; this simple
invention, so ’tis said, paid its inventor $50,000 a year
in royalties for a long time, and so he waxed fat and
grew rich.</p>

<p>Such toys as the dancing dolls, the wheel of life and
the chameleon top brought their respective inventors
even larger sums, while the roller skate which Plimpton
improved and made popular by his invention of <i>cramping</i>
the wheels netted him $1,000,000 in royalties and
so you need not feel sorry for him.</p>

<p class="mt2" id="SIMPLE_INVENTIONS"><b>Simple Inventions.&mdash;</b>The next class of inventions
I shall call your attention to is just as simple but they
are different from toys in that they are useful.</p>

<p>Among them may be named our friend of infant
days, the safety pin, the rubber tip for lead pencils, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
cork nose shield for eyeglasses, the grooved steel rib
for umbrellas, the stylographic pen, the glass lemon
squeezer, paper clips, hook fasteners for shoes and the
shipping tag reinforced around the hole which Dennison
invented and still sells by the carload.</p>

<p>All of these little things and ten thousand others
which you would hardly think were worth inventing
have built up fortunes for those who thought of them
and, more to their credit, were able to see that a future
awaited them.</p>

<p class="mt2" id="REAL_INVENTIONS"><b>Real Inventions.&mdash;</b>In passing we come to some
small but none-the-less real inventions such as the
spring roller window shade, automatic ink stand in
which the ink is always at the same level, barbed wire
fences, Mrs. Potts’ sad iron&mdash;the one with the attachable
and detachable handle, the paragon umbrella
frame, etc.</p>

<p>To the right you will see some inventions of a more
complex kind such as the check protector, mimeograph,
time stamp, combination lock, fountain pen, computing
scale, compressed air rock drill, cash register, the comptometer
and a thousand other devices we see in use or
use ourselves every day. Many of them are small but
each and every one produced anywhere from $10,000
to $1,000,000 for its inventor.</p>

<p class="mt2" id="GREAT_INVENTIONS"><b>Great Inventions.&mdash;</b><i>The Steam Engine, Locomotive,
and Steamboat.</i>&mdash;How the steam engine was invented
by Watt, how the locomotive was invented by
Stephenson and how the steamboat was invented by
Fulton are pretty well known.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>Just how much these great pioneer inventors received
in actual cash for their efforts I cannot say offhand
but it was not large when compared with the
fortunes inventors have since made. But their names
are writ large in the hall of fame, not the one at the
New York University which doesn’t count, but in the
hall of fame of progress and civilization which is the
only one that really matters.</p>

<p id="TELEGRAPH"><i>The Telegraph.</i>&mdash;The <i>telegraph</i> was invented by
Samuel F. B. Morse in 1832 but it was not until 1844
that he had a line working from Washington to Baltimore.
After long years of <i>litigation</i> his patent rights
were upheld by the courts and much wealth and more
fame accrued to him.</p>

<p id="PERFECTING_PRESS"><i>The Perfecting Press.</i>&mdash;The first <i>web printing
press</i>, that is a press using a web, or continuous strip
of paper, was invented by Bullock in 1845 and this
the Hoe Brothers improved upon until the <i>web perfecting
press</i> was evolved by them in 1846 and which
revolutionized the printing of newspapers. The Hoe
factory is the largest maker of printing presses
in the world to-day.</p>

<p id="SEWING_MACHINE"><i>The Sewing Machine.</i>&mdash;After many experiments by
others the <i>sewing machine</i> was invented by Elias
Howe and patented by him in 1846. Like every other
inventor who has a really great thing his patents were
attacked in the court and for eight years he lived in
poverty. When the courts finally found in his favor
he made millions out of the royalties on his labor saving
invention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p id="ICE_MACHINE"><i>The Ice Machine.</i>&mdash;The first machine for making
ice was invented by A. C. Twining in which
<i>ethyl ether</i> was used for the compressed gas and for
which a patent was granted in 1850. In 1867 an <i>ice
machine</i> was made by Ferdinand Carré which used
<i>liquid ammonia</i> for the compressed gas and from that
date on the artificial production of ice on a commercial
scale really began. Whether these two inventors made
fortunes out of their brain children I cannot say, but
this I know, that tens of millions have flowed into the
coffers of those who commercialized their work.</p>

<p id="STEEL_PROCESS"><i>The Steel Process.</i>&mdash;The process of converting iron
into steel cheaply and in quantities was invented by
Henry Bessemer who patented it in 1855. It was the
<i>Bessemer process</i> which made it possible to use steel
for rails and structural purposes generally. The inventor
grew rich beyond the dreams of the romancer
and the steel industry has made multimillionaires of all
its captains.</p>

<p id="GAS_ENGINE"><i>The Gas Engine.</i>&mdash;Many inventions for using gas
as the motive power for engines were made before
1861 but it was not until that year that N. A. Otto built
a working model of a <i>gas engine</i> in which the explosive
gases were mixed, compressed, and ignited in
one cylinder when the waste gases were exhausted from
it. The Otto gas engine became a commercial success
in 1878 and netted the inventor many millions.</p>

<p id="DYNAMO"><i>The Dynamo and Motor.</i>&mdash;The principle on which
the <i>dynamo electric machine</i> works was discovered by
Faraday in 1831. In 1866 both Wilde and Siemens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
built <i>dynamos</i>, but it was Gramme who made the
dynamo a commercial machine by inventing the <i>ring
armature</i>, which he did in 1870. Then some genius,
or bonehead, no one seems to know which, found that
when a current was passed through a dynamo it became
a <i>motor</i>. From 1880 inventions for electric
light, heat and power advanced by leaps and bounds
and everybody that invented anything at all worth
while in the electrical line got rich quick.</p>

<p id="AIR_BRAKE"><i>The Air Brake.</i>&mdash;The <i>air brake</i> to stop and control
the speed of trains was invented by Westinghouse
in 1869. He had hard work getting any railroad to
give it a trial but once that this was done it very
quickly came into general use. Next to the <i>safety
valve</i> it was the first important safety device applied
to railroads. It has in the past and is still piling up
millions for its inventor.</p>

<p id="TELEPHONE"><i>The Telephone.</i>&mdash;The first use of the word <i>telephone</i>
was made by Charles Wheatstone in 1834, who
applied it to a musical instrument otherwise known as
the <i>magic lyre</i>. In 1854 Charles Bourseul suggested
a way to make a speaking telephone, and in 1860
Johanne Phillip Reis constructed a telephone apparatus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
along the line of Bourseul’s idea; while this instrument
reproduced musical tones it would not reproduce
the human voice.</p>

<p>Alexander Graham Bell began working on the
problem in 1874 and invented the first electric speaking
telephone which he patented, showed in operation
at the <i>Centennial Exhibition</i> at Philadelphia in
1876 and shortly after a company was formed to float
it. Edison made a big improvement in the telephone
in 1878 when he invented the <i>carbon transmitter</i>.
Other rivals appeared in the field and after long years
of costly law suits the rights of Bell were sustained
by the courts and the Bell Telephone Company has had
a practical monopoly of the business in this country
ever since. The invention made Bell and its owners
enormously wealthy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p id="TYPEWRITER"><i>The Typewriter.</i>&mdash;This useful machine was invented
by Charles Thurber in 1843, but it was not
until about 1875 that a practical machine was put on
the market. Millions of dollars have been made out
of the typewriter industry, subsequent inventors coming
in for their big shares, but it is doubtful if the
original inventor received anything more than honorable
mention in the <i>encyclopædias</i> and a monument in
some cemetery for the great benefit he conferred on
mankind.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 123.</span> <span class="smcap1">THE FIRST PHONOGRAPH</span></div>
</div>

<p id="PHONOGRAPH"><i>The Phonograph.</i>&mdash;This wonderful instrument for
recording and reproducing speech and other sounds
was invented by Edison in 1877 and improved by him
in 1888. In 1887 Emile Berliner invented and
patented the <i>graphophone</i> in which the vibrations are
recorded on a disk instead of on a cylinder as it is in
the Edison phonograph.</p>

<p>The phonograph was placed on the market in 1888
and the manufacture of graphophones began in 1897
when both the machines and the records became popular
and rapidly grew into a great industry. The
phonograph is only one of Edison’s 700 inventions
and from some or all of them he has amassed a fortune<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
of $10,000,000, and Berliner, who is also an inventor
of renown, is very wealthy.</p>

<p id="STORAGE_BATTERY"><i>The Storage Battery.</i>&mdash;Like many other great inventions
the <i>storage battery</i> has made millions, but
from the time it was invented by Gaston Planté in 1860
until it became a commercial product in 1880 was too
long a stretch for the originator to have received his
just reward. But those who followed with their little
and big improvements made small and large fortunes
out of them when the Electric Storage Battery Company
of Philadelphia was organized to take over all
the smaller concerns.</p>

<p id="CAMERA"><i>The Snap-Shot Camera.</i>&mdash;The snap-shot camera, or
<i>kodak</i>, is not an invention of magnitude but Eastman
who invented it about 1880 has through his business
ability made it a money-maker second only to inventions
of great utility. So rich is his company that it
paid $300,000 for the simple invention of enabling a
kodak user to write a record on each film when it was
exposed.</p>

<p id="STEAM_TURBINE"><i>The Steam Turbine.</i>&mdash;The steam turbine dates
back to the time of Hero, that is 120 years <span class="smcap">B. C.</span>, and
the place of its birth was Alexandria, Egypt. It consisted
of a copper ball pivoted on trunnions. Projecting
from opposite sides of its equator were two
bent pipes and when the ball was partly filled with
water and heated the steam would spout out of the
bent pipes and on striking the air it reacted on the ball
and this caused it to revolve at a high-speed. For this
reason Hero’s engine was called a <i>reaction</i> turbine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1705 Branca, an Italian, invented a steam turbine
in which a jet of steam was forced through a
nozzle and impinged on the vanes of a paddle-wheel,
the impact of the steam causing it to revolve. Hence
this kind of a turbine is called an <i>impact</i> turbine.</p>

<p>The first steam turbine to be built and operated as
a competitor of the <i>reciprocating</i> engine was made by
De Laval in 1883. It was a reaction turbine and it revolved
at a tremendously high speed. Parsons of
England brought out in 1884 the first multiple expansion
turbine which combined the reaction and the
impulse types. It made 18,000 revolutions per minute
and was directly connected to an electric lighting
dynamo. In a little over thirty years the steam turbine
reached a degree of perfection and economy not
attained in the two hundred odd years of development
of the reciprocating engine and it is now used for driving
the largest steamships.</p>

<p id="THE_AUTOMOBILE"><i>The Automobile.</i>&mdash;The so-called daddy of the
<i>automobile</i> is George B. Selden; he built his <i>first self-moving
wagon</i> in 1878 and applied for a patent on it.
He did not let this patent issue, however, but kept it
alive in the Patent Office until 1895 when in that year
automobiles began to be made and used and he then
had the patent granted to him.</p>

<p>His next step was to sell licenses to the various
gasoline engine automobile manufacturers who paid
him a royalty on each machine sold and in this very
easy and genteel manner he accumulated much money.
But there were some manufacturers who refused to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
recognize his patent rights and hence refused to pay
him royalty. Henry Ford of Detroit was the leader
of these rebellious souls and a bitter patent suit resulted
in which the courts first decided for Selden
and then against him and this ended his monopoly.</p>

<p>Ford organized the Ford Motor Company and at
this writing it is the largest manufacturer of automobiles
in the world. It employs 16,000 men and
turns out 1000 automobiles a day. Mr. Ford has so
much money he doesn’t know what to do with it, but
his great wealth is based upon his business ability and
not upon any patents he may have.</p>

</div>

<p id="INCANDESCENT_LIGHT"><i>The Incandescent Light.</i>&mdash;The first electric <i>incandescent</i>
lamp that was made used a <i>platinum</i> wire for
the filament. J. W. Starr substituted a <i>carbon filament</i>
for the platinum wire, but the first successful incandescent
lamp was produced by Edison in 1879 after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
he had made over 2000 experiments in order to find a
suitable fiber for the filament. In order to be able
to use the incandescent lamps, Edison designed a new
system of distributing the current through several circuits
and between any number of lamps.</p>

<p>The lamps of to-day have filaments of <i>tungsten</i> and
these are sealed in bulbs filled with nitrogen and which
together greatly increases the candle-power and at the
same time uses less current. In 1882 the Pearl Street
Edison station in New York was put into service and
was the first of the great central stations. The
Commonwealth Edison Company of Chicago is the
largest electric lighting system in the world. There
are four stations and together they have an output
of 320,000 kilowatts, or 430,000 horsepower.</p>

<p><i>The Electric Railway.</i>&mdash;The first attempt to build
a railway operated by electricity was made by Thomas
Davenport, a Vermont blacksmith in 1835. Next, C.
T. Page made a sixteen horsepower electric locomotive
in 1850 and when it was tried out on the Baltimore and
Ohio Railroad it ran at a speed of nineteen miles an
hour. Batteries were used in both cases to supply the
current.</p>

<p id="TROLLEY_CAR"><i>The Trolley Car.</i>&mdash;The first practical overhead
electric line was shown in Chicago in 1883 by C. J.
Van Depoele and about the same time Leo Daft built
a third-rail line from Saratoga Springs, N. Y., to
Mount McGregor, while a conduit line was built by
Bently and Knight in Cleveland, Ohio. In 1884 the
first practical trolley line was built in Kansas City and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
from this time on horse- and mule-drawn cars were
doomed, except on West Street in New York City
where they are still used to hold down a <i>franchise</i>.</p>

<p>There were in 1912 about 41,000 miles of track
operated by electricity in the United States; over
76,000 passenger cars were in service and 12,100,000
passengers were carried, all of which goes to show that
there is money in electrical inventions for somebody.</p>

<p id="ELECTRIC_LOCOMOTIVE"><i>The Electric Locomotive.</i>&mdash;The 1913 type of
<i>electric locomotive</i> used on the New York Central is
fifty-seven feet long, weighs 110 tons, has eight motors
of 325 horsepower each, which are mounted on four
trucks and driving eight axles. This powerful locomotive
is capable of hauling a train of 1200 tons at a
speed of sixty miles an hour on a straight level track.
The stockholders of the General Electric Company of
Schenectady, N. Y., profited by their building.</p>

<p id="LINOTYPE"><i>The Linotype.</i>&mdash;The <i>linotype</i> is a machine that is
operated like a typewriter and makes a <i>slug</i> or a
solid line of type from metal type-bars each of which
has a letter on it. These type-bars are then properly
spaced and melted type metal is run into the matrix
they form. This wonderful machine is the invention
of Ottmar Mergenthaler who began working on it in
1876 and completed the machine in 1886. Thousands
of linotype machines are in use at the present time
and it goes without saying that the inventor was richly
rewarded for his hard labors.</p>

<p id="MOV_PICTURES"><i>Moving Pictures.</i>&mdash;The <i>moving-picture</i> industry,
which is the third largest in the United States, came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
into being through the following inventions: In 1845
a toy called the <i>zoetrope</i>, or wheel-of-life, was invented;
it was so made that when a series of drawings
showing the different positions of, say, a horse
in motion was viewed through a number of vertical
slits in a rapidly revolving cylinder the horse would
appear to be running. It was truly a moving picture.</p>

<p>The next step was taken by Eadweard Muybridge
in 1877, who was the first to make a series of instantaneous
photographs of a horse in motion, and in
this way he showed the true position of the animal
at different instants of its gait, but since there was no
exactness in timing the intervals between the exposures
of the dry plates&mdash;the film had not yet been invented&mdash;they
could not have been used for moving
pictures.</p>

<p>The photographic gelatine film having come into
use, Edison, in 1893, invented two machines, the
<i>kinetograph</i> which was a camera for taking successive
pictures of moving objects, and the <i>kinetoscope</i> which
allowed the pictures made on the film by the kinetograph
to be viewed. The kinetoscope showed each
picture on the film to the eye for about ¹/₄₀th of a
minute, so that the figures seemed to move as in actual
life. And this is the way the moving-picture industry
was born. It was easy to combine a projecting lantern
and a kinetoscope so that the little photographs on the
film could be thrown on a screen and enlarged and
this is the principle of all moving-picture machines as
they are now constructed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>The moving-picture business has taken a tremendous
hold on the public all over the world. This is shown
by the fact that in 1914 the distributers for three of
the largest film makers handled 75 per cent. of the
films released and are said to have received $15,000,000
for them. In 1915 the daily average attendance of
moving-picture shows in the United States was about
5,000,000 people.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p id="WIRELESS_TELE"><i>The Wireless Telegraph.</i>&mdash;The <i>wireless telegraph</i>
was invented by William Marconi, who showed a set
in operation, in 1896, between the General Postoffice
and the Thames embankment in London, the distance
being about 300 feet. Since that time he has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
almost constantly engaged in patent suits with infringers.</p>

<p>Since then the signaling range has been increased
until now a regular telegraph service without wires is
carried on across the Atlantic. I do not know how well
the inventor fared financially but whatever the amount
he got, it was not nearly enough for his great work.</p>

<p id="WIRELESS_TELEPHONE"><i>The Wireless Telephone.</i>&mdash;The <i>wireless telephone</i>
was invented by the author of this book in 1899 when
he telephoned without wires between two stations in
Narberth, Pa., a distance of about three blocks. During
the past year the human voice has been transmitted
without wires from Arlington, near Washington, D.
C., eastward to Paris, France, and from Arlington as
far westward as Honolulu, Hawaii. Patent litigation,
patent hold-ups and government persecution have been
my lot. I know about the amount I made out of my
invention but I won’t tell.</p>

<p id="AEROPLANE"><i>The Aeroplane.</i>&mdash;The <i>aeroplane</i> was invented by the
Wright Brothers, Wilbur and Orville. They began
their experiments in flying on the sand-dunes of Kitty
Hawk, N. C., in 1900. Their first efforts were made
with a glider fitted with elevation planes and after
having developed the balancing instinct they installed
a gasoline motor in the glider and this drove two propellers
at the rear of the machine.</p>

<p>With this new born aeroplane they made the first
motor-driven, man-carrying flight in 1903&mdash;a flight
that lasted a small fraction of a minute. From this
time on records and necks were broken by other fliers
who tried to outdo their rivals and undo themselves.</p>

<p id="DESIGN_PATENTS"><b>Design Patents.&mdash;</b>Should you invent, or devise a
new and original design for an object, be it a work of

<p>Design patents run for a term of 3½, or for 7, or
for 14 years as you wish and care to pay for. The
patent attorney’s fees for writing the specification,
making the drawing and seeing the patent application<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
through the patent office is usually $20 regardless of
the term it is to run; the government fee is $10 for
3½ years, $15 for 7 years and $30 for 14 years, making
the total cost of such patents $30, $35 and $50 respectively.</p>

<p class="mt2" id="ASSIGNMENTS"><b>Assignments.&mdash;</b>If you want to you may sell or assign
a part or the whole of your invention before you
file an application for a patent, or you may do the same
thing while your application is pending in the patent
office.</p>

<p>Such an interest in your invention and patent rights
may be disposed of by a complete assignment, by granting
territorial rights, by mortgage, or by shop or other
licenses. In whatever way the assignment, grant or
conveyance is made it must be recorded in the patent
office or it will not be valid.</p>

<p class="mt2" id="CAVEATS"><b>Caveats.&mdash;</b>A <i>Caveat</i> can no longer be filed in
the patent office, the law relating to them having been
repealed July 1, 1910. Before this time an inventor
who had not completed his invention could file a <i>Caveat</i>
in the archives of the patent office where it was kept
a secret for one year, and the time could be renewed
from year to year.</p>

<p>The purpose of a <i>Caveat</i> was to give the inventor
more time to work out his invention and to be notified
should any other inventor apply for a patent on the
same thing. He could then immediately file his own
patent application when an <i>interference</i> would be declared
between them.</p>

and sued for damages. After you have decided on
the trade mark you want to use to show that the product
is of your manufacture you should file an application
to register the trade mark just as you would for a
patent.</p>

<p>There are some kinds of words which you cannot
have registered as a trade mark and you may have
other words in mind which have already been registered
in the patent office; nor can you register a trade
mark unless you have sold your goods outside of your
own State. Patent attorneys do not as a rule charge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
for a search of the trade mark records where an application
for registration is filed through them.</p>

<p>The patent office fee for registering a trade mark is
$10; a patent attorney generally charges $15 for preparing
the specification and $5 additional for making
the drawing which makes a total cost of $30 for a
trade mark. A registered trade mark remains in
force for 20 years and it may be renewed for another
20 years.</p>

<p class="mt2" id="COPYRIGHTS"><b>Copyrights.&mdash;</b>A copyright is the sole right granted
by law to authors and artists to publish and dispose of
their works for a term of 28 years when it may be renewed
for 14 years more making 42 years in all.</p>

<p>A copyright may be had on written articles, books,
lectures or other oral addresses, on dramatic and musical
compositions, photographs, paintings, drawings,
sculpture, plastic work, moving picture photo-plays,
moving pictures other than photo-plays, maps, prints
and pictorial illustrations.</p>

<p>A copyright cannot be had on trade marks, the names
of companies, newspapers, manufactured articles or on
prints or labels which are to be used for any kind of
manufactured articles. Trade marks and patents are
granted for the above classes of work.</p>

<p>The general procedure for obtaining a copyright on
the first named subjects is the same but the <i>application
forms</i> issued by the Copyright Office differ a little
from each other in wording and you should have the
right one.</p>

<p>When you are ready to file an application for a copyright<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
in the United States send to the <i>Register of Copyrights</i>,
Copyright Office, Washington, D. C., for a copy
of <i>Steps Necessary to Secure Copyright Registration</i>
and also a copy of <i>Explanatory Circular</i> No. 12, entitled
<i>Application Forms</i>, for which no charge is made.
A reading of these leaflets will tell you exactly how to
obtain a copyright and also the <i>application form</i> to use.</p>

<p>When you have found from these the application
form you need send again to the Register of Copyrights
for one or more of the application forms, fill it in and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
send it and $1 by money order or bank-draft made
payable to the Register of Copyrights, together with
a 10 cent revenue stamp&mdash;for these are war times&mdash;and
you will receive in turn a certificate of copyright.</p>

<p>By copyrighting the thing yourself you will save just
$9 for this is the amount a patent attorney will charge
you for filing it, and if this isn’t driving screws with a
hammer I’d like to know what it is.</p>

<h3>APPENDIX B<br />
THE METRIC OR DECIMAL SYSTEM</h3>


<p>The <i>metric system</i> is a French system of weights and
measures much used in the arts and sciences in every
civilized country and as each unit is multiplied or divided
by 10 to obtain ascending or descending values it
is much more convenient to use than the older English
system of arbitrary measures.</p>

<p>The metric system is based on the <i>meter</i>, which is one-ten
millionth of the distance from the Earth’s equator
to the North Pole. There are five units, the four latter
being derived from the meter and these are:</p>

<p>1. The <i>meter</i> which is the unit of length and is about
3.280 feet in length.</p>

<p>2. The <i>are</i> which is the unit of surface and is 100
square meters in area.</p>

<p>3. The <i>liter</i> which is the unit of capacity and is 1 cubic
decimeter, which is equal to 1.0567 United States quarts.</p>

<p>4. The <i>stere</i> which is the unit of solidity and is equal
to 1 cubic meter.</p>

<p>5. The <i>gram</i> is the unit of weight and is the weight of
1 cubic centimeter of distilled water at its maxim density.</p>

REDUCING FRICTION</h3>


<p>When two bodies are rubbed together the motion is opposed
by a force called <i>friction</i>. When two surfaces
slide against each other the friction between them is
proportional to the force pressing them together. The
<i>amount</i> of friction depends upon the pressure of the bodies,
the roughness of their surfaces and also slightly on
their <i>adhesion</i>. The friction is the same regardless of
the speed with which the surfaces slide over each other.</p>

<p>The <i>co-efficient of friction</i> is the measure of friction
and this is found by dividing the <i>force of friction</i> by the
<i>force pressing the surfaces together</i>. Here are a few
co-efficients of sliding friction:</p>

<p>A <i>spur-gear</i> is a gear with teeth cut on its <i>periphery</i>,
that is an ordinary cog-wheel. <i>Miter gears</i> are two <i>bevel
gears</i> of the same diameter which run together. A large
miter gear will not mesh with a small miter gear nor with
another bevel gear in the proper manner. Miter and
bevel gears cannot be interchanged with other sets like
spur gears.</p>

HIGH SPEED STEEL</h3>


<p>A special steel alloy which is largely used for turning
tools in <i>engine lathes</i> and which will cut ordinary steel
when the latter is revolved at a high surface velocity is
called <i>high speed steel</i>. A tool made of high speed steel
will not lose its <i>temper</i> and will keep its cutting edge
hour after hour if they are kept cool by a stream of
water running on them. A good high speed steel for
machine tools is known by the trade name of <i>blue-chip</i>
and is manufactured by the Firth-Sterling Steel Company
of Pittsburg, Pa.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 130. The four chief thermometric scales: réaumur,
absolute, fahrenheit and centigrade</span></div>
</div>

<p>There are four different thermometer scales used
for measuring temperature and these are (1) the <i>Fahrenheit</i>
scale which is widely used for all ordinary purposes;
(2) the <i>Centigrade</i> which is the standard scale used for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
scientific work since it is based on the decimal system; (3)
the <i>Réaumur</i> scale which is largely used in Germany, and
(4) the <i>absolute</i> scale which is reckoned from <i>absolute
zero</i>, that is the point at which there is absolutely no heat.
It is about 461 degrees Fahr., 274 degrees centigrade, and
219 degrees Réaumur below the zero of these scales.</p>
